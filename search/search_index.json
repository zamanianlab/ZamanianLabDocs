We will also be using it to manage our Python environments. Conda will make it easy to invoke different Python versions as needed for different tasks. conda has several features that make it a powerful tool, but the main feature we will be using is the ability to create virtual environments and install packages to that specific environment. Normally, when you install a piece of software, it is available to run from any directory on your machine. This is good for some software, but sometimes a developer will encourage you to update the software, which inevitably breaks your code. Virtual environments are one solution to this problem. In these cases, instead of installing software to the entire machine, you install it only in a contained environment. Below are instructions on installing and setting up conda, and a representative example of how virtual environments work. Installation There are two flavors of conda - Anaconda and Miniconda. Anaconda is 3 GB and contains quite a few packages and features that are unnecessary for our purposes. We recommend you use Miniconda, which can be installed on macOS using the commands below: wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-MacOSX-x86_64.sh -O ~/miniconda.sh bash ~/miniconda.sh -p $HOME/miniconda3 These commands will download the miniconda installer, run it, and install it to your $HOME folder by following the prompts. It will also add the path $HOME/miniconda3/bin to your lookup $PATH , which allows you to run conda executables without referring explicitly to their location. Usage and an Example Now that conda is installed, let's look at how virtual environments work. First, let's create a new environment that uses Python 3.5: conda create --name test_environment python=3.5 The environment has now been created. You can see a list of all the environments that you have ever created with conda env list . Here is a list of current environments on my machine (* marks current environment): # conda environments: # base * /Users/ $username /miniconda3 dev /Users/ $username /miniconda3/envs/dev test_environment /Users/ $username /miniconda3/envs/test_environment tierpsy /Users/ $username /miniconda3/envs/tierpsy To activate the test_environment that you just created: source activate test_environment Now you are in the virtual environment, using Python 3.5 as a default. You can check to make sure this is the case with python --version . You can also see the path to your environment's Python with which python . Now that you are in the correct environment, you can begin adjusting it to suit your purposes. The main way to do this is by installing certain Python packages that you may use in your analysis. There are multiple ways to install a Python package. The primary means of installation conda install {package name} . If you receive a PackagesNotFoundError , search to identify other means of conda installation. This may include tapping different channels such as bioconda or conda-forge (e.g., conda install --channel bioconda {package name} ). If a package is not available from conda, you may use pip install {package name} . While conda attempts to be compatible with pip, you may occasionally run into issues with packages installed through this route. Package installation example: As an example, we will use conda to install numpy. Numpy is a popular package used for scientific computing, typically computing that involve matrices. First make sure you are in the correct environment, then run: conda install numpy You should receive a message reporting the successful installation of the package. You can ensure successful installation by running Python with python and then attempting to load the package with >>> import numpy as np . If the package was successfully loaded, you will get no message. If it was unsuccessful, you will see: ModuleNotFoundError : No module named 'numpy' To demonstrate the utility of the conda virtual environment, first deactivate the test_environment with source deactivate test_environment . Then repeat the commands python and >>> import numpy as np . If done correctly, you will see that numpy isn't available outside of the test_environment . This way you can keep your base environment clean from unnecessary packages, and you can make sure the packages within a given environment aren't updated unless you explicitly make it so. Zamanian Lab Environments Whenever we begin a new analysis that will include Python scripts, it is the developer's responsibility to build a conda environment that is suitable for those scripts. Instructions for creating this environment should be included in the README file on the main page of the associated GitHub repo. Cleaning conda environments can tend to take up a lot of disk space unless you tend to use the same package versions across environments. It's good practice to delete environments that aren't being actively used or updated (but keep notes on what packages and versions you would need to reproduce this environment). conda also has its own cleanup command that should be regularly run: conda clean -ay Useful Resources conda cheatsheet","title":"Conda"},{"location":"comp_conda/#conda","text":"conda is used for \"package, dependency and environment managing\" that is cross platform and enables reproducibility of old code, even when some packages and dependencies have been updated in the meantime. conda can be used for any language and can even act as a manager for bioinformatic software.

Lab Mission and Philosophy A. Research Mission The central ambition of our laboratory is to combine molecular biology, genetics, and computational approaches to improve our understanding of helminth (parasitic worm) biology and our ability to treat globally important human and animal parasitic infections. This includes discovering new drug targets, elucidating mechanisms of drug resistance, and developing new tools for parasite manipulation. Our current work involves the study of mosquito-borne and soil-transmitted nematode parasites, as well as snail (vector) biology in relation to schistosome control. To complement some of our efforts, we exploit the experimental tractability of the model nematode Caenorhabditis elegans . We strive to place all of our work in the context of a growing appreciation for and understanding of parasite genetic diversity. B. Philosophy We look to recruit individuals who share our curiosity and who wish to challenge themselves as they grow their scientific independence. We welcome students and trainees from a variety of backgrounds and with different career ambitions. I take my role as a mentor and advisor very seriously and it is therefore important to me that all members of the lab: (1) remain excited about the science we do, (2) challenge themselves to improve their base of knowledge and technical skills, and (3) engage in meaningful self-reflection about their progress and goals. Axioms: Borrowing from Federico Ardila-Mantilla, we build our lab upon these axioms: Axiom 1. Scientific \u201ctalent\u201d is distributed equally among different groups, irrespective of geographic, demographic, and economic boundaries. Axiom 2. Everyone can have joyful, meaningful, and empowering scientific experiences. Axiom 3. Science is a powerful, malleable tool that can be shaped and used differently by various communities to serve their needs. Axiom 4. Every student deserves to be treated with dignity and respect. C. Mentorship We will hold weekly lab meetings as a springboard for open and critical scientific exchange. I will also schedule regular individual meetings with every member of the lab so that we can discuss research progress and whatever else that may arise. Career development is a multi-faceted endeavor. Where I am positioned to do so, I will identify or help create opportunities that relate to the career aspirations of individual lab members. I will work with trainees to help them hone their scientific writing and communication skills. This will occur through the drafting of manuscripts, as well as the attendance of relevant conferences. Once lab members have a firm grasp of their primary research projects, I will often encourage them to move out of their comfort zones. For many, this may mean achieving fluency in a programming language (e.g., R or Python) useful to their research and future. Lab members should also seek to make use of the expertise of the broader lab and university community. In general, your resources should include a wide network of peers and mentors. Foster relationships with others in your same position and those that are willing to offer advice. It is critical in science to foster your own support network of people you trust, are inspired by, and that have expertise you don\u2019t yet have. D. Lab Citizenship My commitment to your success in research and professional growth is coupled to certain expectations. I expect all members of the lab to take ownership of their projects. I expect members of the lab to lend their help and expertise to one another and understand that our laboratory is a team with common scientific goals. I expect everyone to display good lab citizenship. We place value in an open, collaborative, and safe scientific environment. We expect all members of the lab to be good lab citizens and to follow basic lab rules. 1. Follow all the rules in this guide for ordering and inventorying items 2. Carry out your lab tasks in a timely manner 3. Be helpful to others - this is a team effort! 4. Keep track of items we are low on and place orders in advance 5. Be here during normal work hours so that you can maximize interactions 6. Do not borrow things without asking 7. Clean up after yourselves and put things back in assigned locations 8. Use your own pipettes, tips, and gloves (except where designated) 9. Keep your items confined to assigned bench, freezer, and fridge spaces 10. Follow all the rules when interacting with other spaces (e.g., the insectary) 11. Stay ahead of parasite orders and plan their use accordingly 12. Make sure the lab is properly shut down (communicate before leaving) Lab dress code: For your safety, wear long pants or skirts and closed toed shoes, and tie back long hair. Do not wear shorts, short skirts, sandals, loose clothing, or dangling jewelry. Throughout your scientific career, you will be professionally interacting with people from diverse backgrounds and with diverse beliefs. In the interests of maintaining an inclusive and welcoming lab environment, I ask that you refrain from wearing articles of clothing that are likely to be perceived as hostile to another person\u2019s heritage, ethnicity, gender, religious beliefs, or sexuality. II. Communication and Calendar A. Slack All members of the lab will be asked to install Slack on their computers and phones and will receive an invitation to join the official lab Slack team zamanian-lab.slack.com . Slack will provide a basis for rapid individual and group communication on all research and lab-related matters. B. Google Calendar An official lab Google calendar will be shared and updated with lab meeting times, relevant departmental events, and one-on-one meeting times. Lab members who will be out of town should notify me in advance and mark those dates on the lab calendar so that other lab members are aware should anything arise. Approved vacation days and other time off should also be entered into the lab calendar. III. Research Documentation A. Physical Lab Notebooks All members of the lab should still record the details of their daily research activities in the form of a traditional lab notebook with dated entries. This is a requirement for federally-funded research. Lab notebooks cannot leave the laboratory and must be turned in at the conclusion of your tenure in the lab. B. Electronic Lab Notebooks The laboratory uses Benchling as a shared electronic lab notebook (ELN) and central repository for all molecular biology efforts. Lab members will receive an invitation to join the ZamanianLab Benchling organization page. Electronic summaries of work done and data generated (gels and printouts) should be regularly annotated and recorded into your defined Benchling lab notebook project space. This means that your electronic notes should include the minimal set of notes required to repeat any molecular biology experiment that you have performed. Do not let too much time elapse before you convert your physical notes into electronic form, as it is easier to clear up ambiguities when experiments are fresh in memory. This should develop into a habit. Benchling also provides tools for the planning of molecular cloning tasks and the design of molecular biology reagents. C. Lab Electronic Storage All grad students and postdocs should install the Box Drive application and receive an invitation to edit the ZamanianLab shared Box folder. All students and staff of the University of Wisconsin-Madison receive Box cloud storage at no cost through their university e-mail accounts. The shared folder will be used to store important lab data, scripts, and documents. DO NOT delete shared folders while your local computer is set to sync as this will delete data across all devices. Do not use spaces in file names, unnecessarily long file names, or vague file naming systems that obscure contents. The primary storage folders are described below: /Data/ This folder should be used to neatly preserve original files and raw data output from various lab and campus instruments (e.g., subfolders /Gels/ , /Sanger/ , /qPCR/ ), common assays and projects with small data footprints (e.g., subfolders /Ce_assays/ and /RNAi_experiments/ ), as well as minimally processed 'big' data outputs (e.g., subfolder /RNAseq/ ). Other subfolders will be created to represent different project-specific data types where necessary, with strict guidelines for file nomenclature. These folders have clear organization and naming conventions that need to followed. /LabMembers/ Individual lab folders are provided for members of the lab to store their research-related documents. These individual folders should be used to preserve processed data, protocols in the process of optimization, writing (manuscripts, fellowships, and grants), and any computer programs or scripts written to carry out preliminary analyses. The uses of other Box folders are described in subsequent sections. D. Lab Meetings Lab meetings will be held once a week. Every member of the lab should have an updated presentation file (dated YYYYMMDD ) in their personal /LabMeetings/ subfolder. This presentation should contain your overall project goals, divided into sub-aims, as well as data and timelines for specific experiments completed and planned for the coming weeks. You should be prepared to present your progress in this short format every week when called upon. This is a space for all members of the lab to contribute to troubleshooting and to engage in constructive and healthy scientific criticism. E. One-on-One Meetings I will hold weekly one-on-meetings with every graduate student and postdoc, except when I'm traveling or have other commitments that I cannot sideline. You should come prepared with organized summaries of the status of your project(s), to share data you\u2019ve produced, and to outline your next set of planned experiments. Each trainee and I will share a Google Doc to keep track of weekly and long-term goals. We will use this time to troubleshoot and constructively dissect these data and plans. This is also an opportunity for us to discuss general issues and your career development goals. IV. Lab Tasks Every member of the lab will be involved in scheduled lab maintenance in some capacity. This will include things like defined cleaning activities and making common buffers and reagents. Roles are divided between undergraduates and other lab staff: Undergrad Tasks and Staff Tasks . V. General Lab Organization A. Lab Inventory The locations of all reagents and consumables will be stored on Quartzy . Lab members will be expected to return ALL items to their assigned locations after use. It is the responsibility of lab members to make sure the Quartzy inventory is up-to-date. Additional rules are outlined in subsequent sections for inventory of plasmids, bacteria, worm strains, oligos, and parasite materials. B. Lab Ordering Lab order requests should be made through Quartzy. Lab orders can be placed after review and approval. Orders can be placed using either the UW MDS system or lab purchasing card. It is the responsibility of every member of the lab to communicate when we are nearing the end of necessary supplies or reagents so that orders can be placed in a timely manner. Except for routine items (e.g., tips, tubes, and gloves), you should message the PI on Slack prior to placing an order on Quartzy to receive approval. Each request should be associated with a funding source in the Quartzy order form. Orders will be fulfilled on designated days of each week. When items arrive, they should be immediately marked as received, physically dated, and associated with a location on Quartzy. P-card ordering: Items will occasionally have to be ordered with the lab P-card. P-cards are also often used for conference registration. I expect lab trainees to process these orders and to place a pdf receipt (appropriately named) of their order in /LabOrdering/PCARD_receipts for the lab manager to process. C. Physical Organization Rm 235: consumables storage, 4C plate/media storage, liquid N2 stocks Rm 223: parasite and cell culture, plate pouring, glassware, and cleaning Rm 230: molecular biology main lab Rm 229D: microinjection room Third floor: offices, gel imaging station, insectary Operations: Benches and Pipettes will be assigned to each grad student and postdoc. Undergraduates should only use the spaces and pipettes of their lab mentor. Place dirty glassware in assigned sink locations (Rms 223 and 230). Place empty pipette boxes in assigned sink location (Rm 230). Place worm boxes for baking in assigned location (Rm 223). Empty shipping boxes should be placed on the ground outside the lab. Physical storage: Each graduate student and postdoc will have their own rack spaces in the -20C and -80C freezers for personal storage of materials related to individual experiments. Each person is responsible for maintaining proper labeling and notes of their stored items. There are designated storage spaces for lab and commercial plasmids, various bacterials stocks, C. elegans strain stocks, and parasite materials across lab freezers. VI. Lab Stocks Locations and descriptions of all lab worm strains, plasmids, bacteria, and oligos should be stored and updated on Quartzy and in defined spreadsheets where specified. The following protocols and naming conventions must be followed, and lab members are responsible for checking the lab database to avoid naming conflicts prior to placing any new orders and assigning new names. Bacteria, worm strains, and plasmids procured from external sources and with existing names should retain those names. A. Oligo Stocks Use IDT_oligos.xls in /LabOrdering/Oligos/ to enter oligo details for ordering. Check Quartzy to ensure you are using the next oligo number available. Provide complete information ( Species , Oligo Pairing , Molecular Target , Amplicon Length , and Tm ) within the spreadsheet order form. All oligo types (DNA primers, gRNAs) should be assigned an ID with the same naming convention. Orders will be placed by a designated lab member. Oligo Name: oMZ#### Storage box labels (-20C): \"Oligo Stocks #\" * Quartzy Update (Type = 'Oligo or Primer'): Item Name (=Oligo Name) Sequence Technical Details (Species, Target, Tm, Pairing) Location Primers: Make 100 uM lab stocks of each primer oligo and store in Oligo Stocks box (-20C). Add 10*Y (uL) volume to lyophilized primer, where Y is nmol yield to make 100 uM stocks. Keep 10 uM (1:10 of stock) dilutions of primers in your own personal boxes for personal use. Re-order the original stock primer before it runs out. B. Plasmids (Lab and Commercial) Lab Plasmids are plasmids created or designed by our lab for long-term use and storage. Commercial (external) Plasmids are plasmids we have received as gifts or ordered from vendors. Plasmid Name: pMZ#### (lab) or Original Name Storage box labels (-80C & -20C): \"Lab Plasmids #\" or \"Commercial Plasmids #\" Tube Counts: 1 copy (-80C) + 1 or more copies (-20C) * Tube Labels Plasmid Name Concentration Date Frozen * Quartzy Update (Type = 'Plasmids'): Item Name (=Plasmid Name) Amount In Stock (units) Location Date Frozen Resistance Marker Use (e.g., \"gene X RNAi\" or \"C. elegans transgene\") Use the stock(s) in -20C for all molecular biology purposes. When -20C stocks have been depleted, transfer the backup stock from -80C to -20C, and inoculate liquid media with the frozen bacterial stock to replace the plasmid stock in -80C. All intermediary vectors using for cloning that are unlikely to be used for other purposes should be stored in personal boxes until no longer needed. Plasmids note: All completed (inventoried) plasmid sequences should be deposited into the designated lab plasmid Benchling project. Additionally, plasmid sequences and image maps should be exported to the Box folder /LabInventory/Plasmid_Export/ . C. Transformed Bacteria Storage box labels (-80C & N2): \"Lab Plasmid Bacterial Stock #\" and \"Commercial Plasmid Bacterial Stock #\" Tube Counts: 2 copies (-80C) + 1 copy (N2) * Tube Labels Plasmid Name Bacteria (eg., DH5a) Date Frozen * Quartzy Update (Type = 'Transformed Bacteria'): Item Name (=Plasmid Name) Amount In Stock (units) Location Bacteria (eg., DH5a) Date Frozen Plasmid (=Plasmid name) Resistance Marker D. Feeding ( C. elegans ) Bacteria Boxes specific to each bacteria (e.g., OP50, HB101, NA22) used for C. elegans feeding should be stored in the designated area of the -80C, noted with how many tubes of each bacteria per box in Quartzy. Replace all bacterial stocks before using up the -80C stock. Storage box labels (-80C): \"Bacteria Name\" Tube Counts: Variable * Tube Labels Bacteria (e.g., OP50) Date Frozen * Quartzy Update (Type = 'Feeding Bacteria'): Item Name (=Bacteria Name) Amount In Stock (units) Location Date Frozen E. Competent Bacteria Boxes specific to each competent bacteria (DH5a, NE5a, JM109) should be stored in the designated area of the -80C, noted with how many tubes of each bacteria per box in Quartzy. Replace all bacterial stocks before using up the -80C stock. Storage box labels (-80C): \"Bacteria Name\" Tube Counts: Variable * Tube Labels Bacteria (e.g., DH5a) Date Frozen * Quartzy Update (Type = 'Competent Bacteria'): Item Name (=Bacteria Name) Location Date Frozen VI. Caenorhabditis elegans Strains A. Strain Creation Only the lab manager (Kathy) is allowed to use the microinjection apparatus to create transgenic strains. It will be the responsibility of any person who wishes for a strain to be made to: 1. Coordinate with Kathy at least two weeks in advance 2. Provide necessary background strain for injection (if not N2) 3. Provide injection mixes in the Plasmids box in the top freezer in room 223 - Mark the tube with the date and all plasmids included in the mix - Including any fluorescent or phenotypic marker that should be followed 4. Provide all required information in the inventory spreadsheet (see below) It is your responsibility to monitor injected lines and select for stable lines and confirming genotypes (through PCR and other approaches). Provide Kathy with the F1 plates to chunk from and cryogenically preserve once you have decide to keep any transgenic lines. B. Strain Inventory Lab strain designation: ZAM# Lab allele designation: maz# C. elegans strains we receive from CGC, as gifts from other labs, or that we create in the lab will be frozen by the lab manager. Five tubes will be frozen at once, with one of those tubes frozen in the Liquid Nitrogen Tank. Strains must be associated with COMPLETE genotypic information (e.g., Transgenes, Alleles, Strain Background) on Quartzy AND in the C. elegans Strain Database linked in Lab Sheets . C. Strain Maintenance Maintain strains in your assigned areas of the 15/20C incubators, or above your bench if incubating at ambient temperature. Use assigned colors to label your plate boxes. Wrap old plates and dispose of contaminated plates regularly. Your contaminated plates (bacteria, fungi, or mites) can jeopardize the experiments of others! Request chunks or frozen strains from the lab manager with adequate notice. Strains should be re-thawed or chunked at least once every six months to avoid mutation accumulation. Update the Rm 230 whiteboard with the strains you are actively maintaining. Boxes should be baked before using them to propagate new strains. VII. Parasite and Insectary Operations A. Parasite Delivery Schedule We generate parasites through local infections and receive regular shipments of filarial parasites ( B. malayi , B. pahangi , and D. immitis ) from the NIH FR3 repository. The Lab Manager will place external orders for many months ahead and the expected scheduling of all parasite stage and materials will be updated on the Parasite Schedule Sheet linked in Lab Sheets . Keep track of both local and external parasite orders. Shipments do not always arrive as expected, but you should have a detailed list of future parasite needs on the spreadsheet . I will send out a FedEx confirmation once I receive it (typically one day in advance) in the #Parasite_Planning Slack channel. B. Storage of General Parasite Materials General use (non-experimental) parasite materials should be catalogued and stored in designated racks/boxes. There are individual boxes for B. malayi , B. pahangi, and D. immitis tissues and RNA in the -80C freezer. There is a single box for storage of parasite gDNA in the -20C freezer. The contents of all samples in these boxes should be inventoried for each species in the appropriate tab of the Parasite Tissue and Nucleic Acid Inventory sheet linked in Lab Sheets . The spreadsheet should be immediately updated after placing any new tubes in these boxes. This catalog of materials allows us to plan qPCR, RNA-seq and other experiments. * Tube Labels (combine the following into a single string) 1) Species (First letter of genus + first letter of species) 2) Date (YYYYMMDD) 3) Sample Type (T=tissue, R=RNA, CD=cDNA, GD=gDNA) 4) Number ID (T###) Example: Bm20190530.T001 C. Parasite Infections (Insectary) The Bartholomay Lab insectary is a powerful resource that comes with major responsibilities. All members of the lab should follow established safety protocols and basic lab etiquette when using this space. No member of the lab should carry out insectary operations and procedures without approval from both PIs. Detailed protocols for insectary operations, filarial parasite infection, and L3 isolation can be found on our Protocols page. Mosquito strains available for parasite infection: Ae. aegypti LVP strain: used for B. malayi and B. pahangi infections Ae. aegypti SD strain: used for D. immitis infections Strains must be ordered in advance for infection, accounting for potential die offs and typical L3 yields. Place Orders as instructed in the Insectary Protocol and update the Parasite Schedule Sheet linked in Lab Sheets to associate parasite batches with mosquito infections Mosquito Carton Labels Mosquito spp.: Parasite spp.: Parasite Source: Date Infected: Titer: Extraction Date: VIII. Writing and Reference Management To streamline collaborative writing and/or editing of manuscripts and fellowship applications, lab members should create Google Docs to share documents with me and others involved in the writing goal. Paperpile will be used to manage references. Paperpile is compatible with Google Docs. A lab license will be made available to those who require it. For those who prefer LaTeX over traditional word processing, OverLeaf is also an acceptable alternative to Google Docs. All final data, figures, scripts, and text associated with manuscript submissions should be organized within /Manuscripts/ and in a manuscript-specific GitHub project. IX. Lab Safety All lab members must take the appropriate safety training before starting any lab work and to use appropriate PPE at all times. Lab biosafety protocols and procedures will also be provided in binder and electronic form ( /LabSafety/ ). In the event of emergencies involving accident or injury, call 911 to be routed to the campus police. Training required for everyone \"Biosafety Required Training\" ( EHS ) Animal-related training for IACUC-approved work \"Animal User Orientation\" ( RARC ) \"Safety for Personnel with Animal Contact\" ( EHS ) \"Animal Contact Risk Questionnaire (ACRQ)\" ( UHS ) Additional 1-in-1 Training Offered through RARC (e.g., Mouse Training) For work with human cell lines and potentially infectious materials \"Biosafety 102: Bloodborne Pathogens for Laboratory and Research\" ( EHS ) E-mail both the Bartholomay and Zamanian lab list-servs (bartlab at lists.wisc.edu and zamanianlab at lists.wisc.edu) in advance of BSL2 work in the insectary space. Put up BSL-2 signs on doors and include location, time, and reminder for PPE. Example e-mail: \"I will be performing bulk parasite extractions from infected LVP mosquitoes TOMORROW (27/11/18). I will be performing the extractions in the screened-in work space inside the insectary (room 322). The parasites I will be extracting are Brugia pahangi L3s, and are classified as a BSL-2 organism. I will be working from 9:30AM - 12:30 PM, and will have signs posted on the outside of the screened-in area. If you need to enter this area during this time, please mind the PPE requirements specified on the posted BSL-2 signs. If this is a conflict/problem for anybody, please contact me as soon as possible. Thank you.\"","title":"Lab Manual"},{"location":"labmanual/#zamanian-lab-manual-v-20","text":"","title":"Zamanian Lab Manual v 2.0"},{"location":"labmanual/#i-lab-mission-and-philosophy","text":"","title":"I.

This includes discovering new drug targets, elucidating mechanisms of drug resistance, and developing new tools for parasite manipulation. Our current work involves the study of mosquito-borne and soil-transmitted nematode parasites, as well as snail (vector) biology in relation to schistosome control. To complement some of our efforts, we exploit the experimental tractability of the model nematode Caenorhabditis elegans . We strive to place all of our work in the context of a growing appreciation for and understanding of parasite genetic diversity.","title":"A.

Axioms: Borrowing from Federico Ardila-Mantilla, we build our lab upon these axioms: Axiom 1. Scientific \u201ctalent\u201d is distributed equally among different groups, irrespective of geographic, demographic, and economic boundaries. Axiom 2. Everyone can have joyful, meaningful, and empowering scientific experiences. Axiom 3.

Career development is a multi-faceted endeavor. Where I am positioned to do so, I will identify or help create opportunities that relate to the career aspirations of individual lab members. I will work with trainees to help them hone their scientific writing and communication skills. This will occur through the drafting of manuscripts, as well as the attendance of relevant conferences. Once lab members have a firm grasp of their primary research projects, I will often encourage them to move out of their comfort zones. For many, this may mean achieving fluency in a programming language (e.g., R or Python) useful to their research and future. Lab members should also seek to make use of the expertise of the broader lab and university community. In general, your resources should include a wide network of peers and mentors. Foster relationships with others in your same position and those that are willing to offer advice.

The HTC System Compute Nodes The CHTC has an extensive set of execute nodes that can be accessed for free. To establish priority access for certain pipelines, our lab has secured a prioritized node that can be accessed on-demand using a designated flag. Typical nodes: 20 cores, 128 GB RAM High-memory nodes : e.g., 80 cores, 4 TB RAM Dedicated lab node: 40 cores (80 hyperthreading), 512 GB RAM, 3.8 TB HD [ Maximum request on lab node: CPU = 80; Memory = 500GB, Disk = 3500GB ] Submit nodes Jobs on the CHTC are deployed from submit nodes. You can ssh into your assigned submit node to run and monitor jobs using your UW net-id and password. ssh {net-id}@submit3.chtc.wisc.edu File system The CHTC does not use a shared file system, but you can request the storage you need for any given job. Each net-id will be associated with a home folder, where you will manage your job submission scripts. Each net-id will also be associated with a staging folder, for transfer of files in and out of the CHTC system. / \u251c\u2500\u2500 home/{net-id}/ [initial quota: 20 GB, submit script dir] \u2514\u2500\u2500 staging/{net-id}/ [initial quota: 200 GB | 1000 files] \u2514\u2500\u2500 input/ [input dir: unprocessed (raw) data] \u2514\u2500\u2500 output/ [output dir: processed job outputs] Deploying Pipelines Staging input data for processing Transfer a single folder containing your job input files to the staging input directory.

Submission files (.sub) should follow lab conventions and be consistent with the CHTC documentation. An example submit script with annotations is shown below. This submit script (Core_RNAseq-nf.sub) loads a pre-defined Docker environment and runs a bash executable script (Core_RNAseq-nf.sh) with defined arguments (staged data location). Other options define standard log files, resource requirements (cpu, memory, and hard disk), and transfer of files in/out of home . Avoid transferring large files in/out of home ! We transfer in our large data through /staging/{net-id}/input/ and we move job output files to /staging/{net-id}/output/ within the job executable script to avoid their transfer to home upon job completion. The only files that should be transferred back to home are small log files.

Submission files (.sub) should follow lab conventions and be consistent with the CHTC documentation. An example submit script with annotations is shown below. This submit script (Core_RNAseq-nf.sub) loads a pre-defined Docker environment and runs a bash executable script (Core_RNAseq-nf.sh) with defined arguments (staged data location). Other options define standard log files, resource requirements (cpu, memory, and hard disk), and transfer of files in/out of home . Avoid transferring large files in/out of home ! We transfer in our large data through /staging/{net-id}/input/ and we move job output files to /staging/{net-id}/output/ within the job executable script to avoid their transfer to home upon job completion. The only files that should be transferred back to home are small log files.

For most strains, one plate is enough. For sick strains, more plates will result in a higher titter and therefore a better thaw rate. Use two places for transgenic strains. Check the genotype of the strain so you can follow any phenotypes to make sure the animals are correct. Store the plates at the optimal temperature for your strain (20\u00b0C for most strains) until the 10 cm plate is starved. The strain is ready to freeze when there is no bacteria on the plate and there are few or no embryos remaining on the plate. Most of the animals should be L1, L2, or dauer. Prepare the number of cryovial tubes with cryo-safe labels with the appropriate information (e.g. strain name, date frozen, genotype, genotype, the initials of the person who froze the strain, etc.) that you want to freeze. Use \"Cryovials Label Template\" for printing labels with the correct information. We currently freeze five cryovial tubes per strain: four for our working stocks and one for long-term liquid nitrogen storage. You can freeze an extra sixth tube to use as a test thaw if you wish. If you want to freeze more than six tubes, you should prepare more than one 10 cm plate per strain. For freezing transgenic strains the lab creates, freeze four tubes per independent line of that strain. Two for working stocks in the -80\u00b0C, one for liquid nitrogen storage, and one test thaw. When the last tube is thawed, you must refreeze the strain. When the strain is ready to be frozen, use a sterile 10 mL serological pipette to aliquot 3 mL of freezing solution (recipe below) into a 15 mL conical tube. Aliquot ~3.5 mL of M9 (recipe below) into a different 15 mL conical tube. Take the lids off all the cryovials. Wash worms off the plate by pouring the ~3-4 mL of M9 onto the 10 cm plate. Shake/swirl the plate once and then transfer the worms and M9 back to the 15 mL conical. Do this very quickly as the M9 will soak into the plate. If you use less than 3 mL of M9, squirt a little more M9 on the plate and transfer the worms to the 15 mL conical. The final volume in the conical should be 6 mL. If you are freezing more than one plate for a single strain, use 3 mL of M9 between all the plates. Use a new, sterile, glass pipette to pipette the M9/worm/freezing solution mixture up and down once to mix. Be gentle, and do this slowly as to not introduce bubbles into the mixture. Use the same sterile glass pipette to aliquot 1 mL of the M9/worm/freezing solution mixture into each of the tubes, replace the caps, and place tubes in a 1.5 mL tube styrofoam container in the -80\u00b0C. Cover the 1.5 mL tube styrofoam container with the lid and secure with a rubber band. Make sure to enter the strain in the \"Worms\" database in Quartzy. After at least 24 hr., move four tubes to the next available position in the Working Stock Boxes (check Quartzy for the last strain put in position), move one tube to the next available position in the Liquid Nitrogen Stock boxes (check Quartzy) and thaw one tube as a test thaw. Put a space in between each strain that you freeze. If you froze a test thaw, empty the contents of the tube onto a 10 cm plate just after the contents melt. Check the plate after ~48-72 hr. If you see gravid animals and embryos on the plate, the strain survived the thaw. If you do not see gravid animals and embryos, try freezing the strain again, but start with more 10 cm plates (step 1). If the strain has a transgenic marker, check to see if the thawed stock still expresses the marker. As you move the strain into the Working Stock Boxes and the Liquid Nitrogen Stock Boxes, make sure to write down the locations in the Freezer Log (i.e. - write down the information while you are physically moving the strains!). If the strain information is not already in Quartzy, make sure to enter that information (any plasmids/genotypes of the strain, if the strain was lab-made, received form another lab or the CGC, and growing temperature). After the tubes have been to the final Working and Liquid Nitrogen Stock positions (step 12), indicate that information for that strain in Quartzy (and how many are in stock). Notes for freezing more than one strain at a time: Aliquot freezing solution/M9 into all of the necessary 15 mL conicals at once. Leave the caps on loosely so you can move through the protocol more quickly. Arrange your strain plates and sets of tubes in alpha-numeric order. You can put up to six strains in a single styrofoam container. If you have more than 10 strains to freeze, move the tubes for 10 strains (in their styrofoam containers) to the -80\u00b0C freezer before freezing the next set of strains. You don't want the animals in freezer solution at room temperature for too long. You want to move them to -80\u00b0C as soon as possible. Enter your strains in Quartzy (freezer box locations) in the exact order you froze them. That way, when you move the tubes into the Working and Liquid Nitrogen Boxes, the tubes will be in the same order as listed in the Freezer Log. Thawing and Cleaning Worms Remove the right-most freezing solution tube of those remaining in the Working Stock Box. If the left-most tube is the only tube remaining, you must make sure to freeze new copies of this strain after the strain is cleaned. Follow the freezing protocol as listed above, but you should only need to freeze five tubes: four for the Working Stock Boxes and one for the test thaw. Right as the contents of the tube are melting at room temperature, decant the contents onto a clean, seeded 10 cm plate. Incubate the plate at the optimal temperature for the worms. Delete the appropriate tube form the Working Stock Box database in Quartzy. If there is contamination: a.

Freezing Worms Pick worms to six 6 cm plates you wish to freeze for each strain. For most strains, 4-6 plates is enough. For sick strains, more plates will result in a higher titter and therefore a better thaw rate. Check the genotype of the strain so you can follow any phenotypes to make sure the animals are correct. Store the plates at the optimal temperature for your strain (20\u00b0C for most strains) until the 6 cm plates are starved. The strain is ready to freeze when there is no bacteria on the plate and there are few or no embryos remaining on the plate. Most of the animals should be L1 or L2. Prepare the number of cryovial tubes (Room 223, Shelf 2) with cryo-safe labels (Printed on Label maker) with the appropriate information (e.g. - strain name, date frozen) that you want to freeze. Use \"Cryovials Label Template\" for printing labels with the correct information. We currently freeze six cryovial tubes per strain: four for our working stocks, one for long-term liquid nitrogen storage and one to use as a test thaw. For freezing transgenic strains the lab creates: freeze five tubes per independent line of that strain. Three for working stocks in the -80\u00b0C, one for liquid nitrogen storage, and one to use as a test thaw. When the last tube is thawed, you must re-freeze the strain. Get an ice bucket. Heat the Freezing Buffer (Peggy's recipe) in the microwave very slowly, checking every 30 seconds to see if it is melted. Put it in a 50 degree water bath until ready to use. Loosen the lids of all the cryovials. With a serological pipet, take about 6.5 mL of M9 for six 6 cm plates and dispense on the first six cm plate. Wash the worms off the plate. Using the same serological pipet, continue to wash worms off from all the plates. Put 1 mL of worms and M9 solution in each cryovial. Less volume can be added to the test thaw cryovial but remember how much was added for the addition of the Freezing Buffer step. Put cryovials with worms on ice for 5 min. Start a timer to check elapsed time of worms on ice. Add an equal amount of Freezing Buffer as M9 buffer per tube. This will be 1 mL except maybe for the test thaw tube. Vortex the cryovial. Then put the cryovials back on ice for 5 min. The elapsed time for adding the freezing buffer and vortexing should be about 5-6 min. Place tubes in a 1.5 mL tube styrofoam container in the -80\u00b0C. Cover the 1.5 mL tube styrofoam container with the lid and secure with a rubber band. Make sure to enter the strain in the \"Worms\" database in Quartzy. After a week or so, a test thaw can be done. Use the small styrofoam carton in the bottom of the -80\u00b0C with a metal block on dry ice to hold your agar frozen worm strains. Take the cryovial that needs to be thawed and place it in the metal block for transport to the bench. Rub the vial between your palm for 2 seconds. Heat a metal spatula in a flame and rotate around the outside of the cryovial until you can get a chunk free to place on a 10 cm plate. Place the chunk on the outer edge of the plate. Keep the melted worms to the outside of the plate as you want them to crawl into the OP50. Put the cryovial back into -80\u00b0C along with the metal block. Put the plate at the desired temperature for the worm strain. Check the plate after ~48-72 hr. If you see gravid animals and embryos on the plate, the strain survived the thaw. If you do not see gravid animals and embryos, try freezing the strain again, but start with more 6 cm plates (Step 1). If the strain has a transgenic marker, check to see if the thawed stock still expresses the marker. Move four tubes to the next available position in the Worm Stock Boxes (check Quartzy for the last strain put in position), move one tube to the next available position in the Liquid Nitrogen Stock boxes (check Quartzy). Put a space in between each strain that you freeze. If the strain information is not already in Quartzy, make sure to enter that information (any plasmids/ genotypes of the strain, where we got the strain, if it was lab-made or received from another lab or the CGC, growing temperature, etc.). After the tubes have been to the final Worm Stock and Liquid Nitrogen Stock positions (Step 12), indicate that information for that strain in Quartzy (and how many are in stock). Thawing and Cleaning Worms Use the small styrofoam carton in the bottom of the -80\u00b0C with a metal block on dry ice to hold your agar frozen worm strains. Take the cryovial that needs to be thawed and place in the metal block for transport to the bench. Rub the vial between palms for 2 seconds. Heath a metal spatula in a flame and rotate around the outside of a cryovial until you can get a chunk free to place on a 10 cm plate. Place the chunk on the outer edge of the plate. Keep the melted worms to the outside of the plate as you want them to crawl into the OP50. Put cryovial back into -80\u00b0C along with the metal block. Delete the appropriate tube form the Worm Stock Box database in Quartzy. If there is bacterial contamination: Once there are gravid animals on the 10 cm plate, bleach the animals to clean any bacterial contaminants: Place 15 \u03bcL of bleach solution (recipe below) on the edge of a labeled 6 cm plate. Place a minimum of 6 gravid animals into the bleach (10-15 animals is good). The bleach should dissolve the cuticle of the adult worms, releasing the embryos. Leave the plate lid-side up until all the bleach has soaked into the plate. After the bleach has soaked in, move the plate, lid-side down, to the optimal temperature for the worms. After ~24 hr., move L1s from the bleach plate to 4 separate clean, labeled 6 cm plates. You want between 10-20 L1s per plate - the more, the better.

Dump the contents of the bottle into the flask. c. Pour sterile water into the bottle and swirl to get any powder reagents off the sides. d. Pour the water from the bottle into the flask, making sure to rinse any powder stuck on the funnel into the flask. e. Repeat steps c and d until you've poured in all the sterile water. Cover the mouth of the flask with foil and tape in place with autoclave tape (autoclave room). Use label tape to label the flask with: media (e.g. NGM or HGM), date of pour, and your initials. Note: you can simply move the tape label from the plastic bottle to the flask, making sure to also write the date of pour on the label. Add stir bar. Autoclave the following with a 60 min. liquid cycle: a. 1 L H 2 O in a 1 L bottle. b. Liquid dispenser hoses capped and wrapped with aluminum foil. c. NMG or HGM media. Turn on the water baths in lab room 230 and set temperature to 55\u00b0C while the media is still in the autoclave. Once sterilization of media is complete, bring the flask to the lab and allow it to cool to 55\u00b0C in the water bath for at least an hour (maximum of four hr.) and then add the following to the media in the exact order listed . Gently swirl to mix after addition of each reagent. Reagent 1 L 2 L 1 M KH 2 PO 4 (K Phosphate Buffer) 25 mL 50 mL Cholesterol (5 mg/mL in Ethanol) 1 mL 2 mL 1 M CaCl 2 1 mL 2 mL 1 M MgSO 4 1 mL 2 mL Note: If these solutions are already made, make sure they are autoclaved (except Cholesterol) or filter-sterilized before adding to the media. Operating the PourBoy Things you will need to autoclave before PourBoy use: PourBoy input and output tube: wrap the tube openings with foil, then fold the tubes up and wrap both tubes together in foil. Place autoclave tape on the wrapping. 1 L sterile water (for cleaning of the PourBoy prior to use) Once autoclaved, remove foil from one end of one of the tubes (tube 1) and connect that end to the input port (refer figure), then remove foil from one end of the other tube (tube 2) and connect that end to the output port. Run 200 mL of hydrogen peroxide through the PourBoy. Check PourBoy settings. Use the \"POUR\" up and down buttons to set the volume that must be dispensed into each plate Press and release the \"MODE/CAL\" button to switch between Manual mode (dispenses once per foot pedal operation) and Auto mode (dispenses indefinitely, with a pause interval between dispensing operations). Use the \"PAUSE\" up and down buttons to increase and decrease the interval between dispensing operations in auto mode. Foot pedal is hard-wired to the PourBoy pump and you should not attempt to remove it. Note: Be very careful with the ends of the tubes from this point forward. They are sterile and must be kept sterile while pouring plates. Do not allow them to touch anything but the inside of the autoclaved media, water, or aluminum foil. Place the autoclaved bottle of water on the hot plate (setting \u2158). Remove the foil from the other end of tube 1 and lower the tube into autoclaved water (<100\u00b0C). Remove foil from the other end of tube 2 and hold over a plastic jug to collect dispensed water. Ensure that the tube does not touch the sides of the non-sterile jug. Use the foot petal to pass water through the tubes to sterilize the pump drive coil. Use a plastic receptacle (Shelf 5) as a waste container for water/media. Once you've passed ~300-400 mL of water, switch tube 1 to the flask with media (bring to room 223 from the water bath in room 230), kept on the hot plate. Once the tube is in the flask, cover the mouth of the flask with foil. Bring the water to the water bath. Wipe down the working area with 70% ethanol and then spread individual plates out on the table. While holding the lid of a plate open, move the dispensing end of tube 2 over the plate and use the foot pedal to dispense the set volume of media. Then move on to the next plate. Be sure not to touch the tip of the tubing onto any part of the plate. Throughout the plate pouring procedure, remember to watch the flask to ensure that the media is getting into the tubing even when there is only a small volume of media left in the flask. If the opening of the tubing is not completely covered by media, air will get into the tubing, which results in bubbles in the plates. Plates with bubbles are not usable. Tip the flask to the side to pour out the last few plates. Stop the pouring if there is not enough media left (less than the volume for one plate). Once the desired number of plates have been poured, switch tube 1 from the flask with 200 mL of hydrogen peroxide and run entire volume through. Then, switch to the bottle with hot water (switch the water with the media flask on the hot plate to heat up the water) and foot pedal 300-400 mL of water through the PourBoy to flush out media before it solidifies in the tubes and pump drive coil. Once all plates are solidified (~15 min. for 6 cm plates and ~30 min. for 10 cm plates) stack them up ( lid-side up ) and use labelling tape to label them with the name of media, name of the person that poured the plates, time, and date. Leave plates stacked on benchtop for two days. Place in a clean a plastic box wiped down with 70% ethanol (wipe down all sides of the box until dry). Then stack the poured plates in the box, lid-side down . Transfer the labelling tape form step 9 to the box. Store the box in the 4\u00b0C deli-style fridge. Note: When pouring many plates, there is not enough room on the bench to fit all of the plates in the media. To maximize space, you can stack 3-4 plates on top of each other and pour from the bottom up of each stack. When done with a stack, place the flask of media back in the 55\u00b0C water bath, and wait for the plates to dry (20-30 min.). Once dry, stack all of the plates on the right end of the bench and place out more stacks of plates to pour. Continue and repeat until all of the media has been poured.

Place autoclave tape on the wrapping. 1 L sterile water (for cleaning of the PourBoy prior to use) Once autoclaved, remove foil from one end of one of the tubes (tube 1) and connect that end to the input port (refer figure), then remove foil from one end of the other tube (tube 2) and connect that end to the output port. Run 200 mL of hydrogen peroxide through the PourBoy. Check PourBoy settings. Use the \"POUR\" up and down buttons to set the volume that must be dispensed into each plate Press and release the \"MODE/CAL\" button to switch between Manual mode (dispenses once per foot pedal operation) and Auto mode (dispenses indefinitely, with a pause interval between dispensing operations). Use the \"PAUSE\" up and down buttons to increase and decrease the interval between dispensing operations in auto mode. Foot pedal is hard-wired to the PourBoy pump and you should not attempt to remove it. Note: Be very careful with the ends of the tubes from this point forward. They are sterile and must be kept sterile while pouring plates. Do not allow them to touch anything but the inside of the autoclaved media, water, or aluminum foil. Place the autoclaved bottle of water on the hot plate (setting \u2158). Remove the foil from the other end of tube 1 and lower the tube into autoclaved water (<100\u00b0C). Remove foil from the other end of tube 2 and hold over a plastic jug to collect dispensed water. Ensure that the tube does not touch the sides of the non-sterile jug. Use the foot petal to pass water through the tubes to sterilize the pump drive coil. Use a plastic receptacle (Shelf 5) as a waste container for water/media. Once you've passed ~300-400 mL of water, switch tube 1 to the flask with media (bring to room 223 from the water bath in room 230), kept on the hot plate. Once the tube is in the flask, cover the mouth of the flask with foil. Bring the water to the water bath. Wipe down the working area with 70% ethanol and then spread individual plates out on the table. While holding the lid of a plate open, move the dispensing end of tube 2 over the plate and use the foot pedal to dispense the set volume of media. Then move on to the next plate. Be sure not to touch the tip of the tubing onto any part of the plate. Throughout the plate pouring procedure, remember to watch the flask to ensure that the media is getting into the tubing even when there is only a small volume of media left in the flask. If the opening of the tubing is not completely covered by media, air will get into the tubing, which results in bubbles in the plates. Plates with bubbles are not usable. Tip the flask to the side to pour out the last few plates. Stop the pouring if there is not enough media left (less than the volume for one plate). Once the desired number of plates have been poured, switch tube 1 from the flask with 200 mL of hydrogen peroxide and run entire volume through. Then, switch to the bottle with hot water (switch the water with the media flask on the hot plate to heat up the water) and foot pedal 300-400 mL of water through the PourBoy to flush out media before it solidifies in the tubes and pump drive coil. Once all plates are solidified (~15 min. for 6 cm plates and ~30 min. for 10 cm plates) stack them up ( lid-side up ) and use labelling tape to label them with the name of media, name of the person that poured the plates, time, and date. Leave plates stacked on benchtop for two days. Place in a clean a plastic box wiped down with 70% ethanol (wipe down all sides of the box until dry). Then stack the poured plates in the box, lid-side down . Transfer the labelling tape form step 9 to the box. Store the box in the 4\u00b0C deli-style fridge. Note: When pouring many plates, there is not enough room on the bench to fit all of the plates in the media. To maximize space, you can stack 3-4 plates on top of each other and pour from the bottom up of each stack. When done with a stack, place the flask of media back in the 55\u00b0C water bath, and wait for the plates to dry (20-30 min.). Once dry, stack all of the plates on the right end of the bench and place out more stacks of plates to pour. Continue and repeat until all of the media has been poured.

Preparing Items for Autoclaving Dry (Empty) Glassware If you are sterilizing empty, dry glass labware, autoclave-safe plastic labware, foil-wrapped items, or any other non-liquid item, follow these steps: Glass bottles with caps - washed, air-dried completely, capped with cap half-loosened, autoclave tape on top of lid. Plastic large centrifuge bottles with caps - washed, air-dried completely, capped with cap very loosely covering the opening and NOT tightened, autoclave tape on top of lid.

Glass or plastic containers with no lids (flasks, beakers, etc.) - washed, air-dried completely, covered in heavy-duty aluminum foil with no holes and aluminum hanging at least 1 inch over the edge of the opening, autoclave tape on top of the foil cover. Glassware Containing Liquids If you are sterilizing liquids in a container with a lid (bottles & tubes) or covered with aluminum foil (glass flasks & beakers), follow the steps here: Glass bottles with caps containing liquid media, water, or buffers - liquid filled no more than container fill-line, capped with cap slightly-loosened one turn to prevent loss, autoclave tape on top of lid. Glass bottles with caps containing liquid media with agar - liquid filled no more than HALF-VOLUME of the container, capped with cap slightly-loosened one turn to prevent loss, autoclaved tape on top of lid.

Autoclaving Items Round Hatch Autoclave Write your name on the chalkboard next to the autoclave you will be using to reserve the autoclave for your use. Also record your use in the log book. Turn the autoclave dial to \"Load\" 5-10 min. before loading to get the jacket pressure between 15-20 psi. When the jacket pressure has reached 15-20 psi, load the bin with your lab items and close the door. To ensure the door is sealed shut, turn the hatch clockwise until absolutely tight (some autoclaves require very tight seals!). Note: Use the orange heat-protection gloves to protect yourself from the heat of the autoclave anytime you are opening the autoclave and inserting/removing items. Wait in the room for 5 min. after initiating sterilization to ensure the door is sealed adequately and no water is leaking out. If there is a leak, tighten the hatch further. Also ensure the chamber pressure reaches 15-20 psi. If the leak does not stop, abort the run (turn dial to \"liquid cool\" or \"vent\") and notify Jesse Waters at jesse.waters@wisc.edu to generate a work order. Allow sterilization for 5-10 min. more than the desired sterilize time (this allows for complete sterilization after the chamber has reached 15-20 psi). When sterilization is complete, turn the dial to \"liquid cool\" (if sterilizing liquids) or to \"vent dry\". Wait for the pressure to drop to 0 (usually takes about 10 min. after dial turn) before opening the door (turn hatch counter-clockwise). Stand back behind the hatch while opening the door in order to avoid burn injury from escaping steam. Turn the dial to \"Off\". Use heat-protection gloves to take the bin out of the autoclave. Place the bin on a cart to take it to the lab. Return gloves to the autoclave when finished. Steris Autoclave Press the foot petal to open the autoclave.

You will have a couple frustrating sessions when you first attempt this technique. Everyone seems to master injection after a few days, and it works quickly and reliably once you have some experience. Materials Agarose Pads M9 (recovery buffer) Sutter Instruments P-87 needle puller Glass 1BBL w/FIL 1.0 mm 4 IN filaments (WPI #1B100F-4) Halocarbon oil series HC-700, 8 oz. bottle (Sigma-Aldrich, H8898-50ML) Agarose Pads Make a lot of these at a time; they last forever. Using a transfer pipette, drop melted 2% agarose in sterile water on a 24x50 mm coverslip. The size of the droplet should be moderate - not too large, not too small, though this isn't precise nor a rigid requirement. Drop a second coverslip on top, which will flatten the agarose into a thin pad. Try to avoid air bubbles, but a few won't hurt anything. When the agarose has hardened (> 5 s.) slide off the top coverslip. Breathe on the coverslip to see on what side the pad stuck. Use this top coverslip as the bottom coverslip to make the next pad; its thin coating of agarose will make the pad stick to it instead of the fresh top coverslip. Note : This process can be made into an assembly line by lining up many coverslips on the edge of a bench (so you can quickly pick them up) and an equal number of coverslips perpendicular to the first set behind them. Spot the perpendicular coverslip, pick up the one at the edge of the bench, and drop it on top. Drop on the next coverslip to repeat on down the line. You can make 200 coverslips in about a half an hour. Place the coverslips flat in a box and cover the box with aluminum foil to dry. The box can be left out on the bench overnight, or bake in an oven at 65\u00b0C for 1 hr., or bake in an 80\u00b0C oven for 15 min. Once dried, you can store the pads in the original coverslip box. Microinjection Needles We use \"Glass 1BBL w/FIL 1.0 mm 4 IN\" filaments (#1B100F-4) from World Precision Instruments, Inc. Keep these clean and always immediately recap the tube after removing a filament. Needle Puller We use a Sutter Instruments, model P-87 needle puller. Turn the machine on (switch at left side, front). We use program 0 to pull needles for C. elegans microinjection. Press 0 on the keypad to use program 0. Program 0: Pressure = 500. - Heat 970, Pull 0, Velocity 30, Time 250 - Heat 960, Pull 0, Velocity 40, Time 250 - Heat 960, Pull 27-30 1 , Velocity 60, Time 252 1 Depending how long the machine has been running, it will pull needles a little differently (how \"hot\" it is). It is recommended to turn on the machine ~20 min. before pulling needles for injections. Sometimes it is needed to pull a couple of \"fake\" needles before the machine gets it right. Insert a glass filament into the groove of one of the pullers without touching your fingers to the part that will be heated or the filament. Loosen the clamping knob if necessary to allow the glass through. Tighten the knob of the clamp to hold the needle in place. Depress the spring stop on each puller bar to release them from their catch position (shown above). Pull both bars towards each other using the finger bars. Hold bars in position using the thumb an index finger from one hand. The hex head screw should be touching the end slot in both puller bars. Loosen both clamping knobs, carefully slide the glass through the holes in the side of the heater chamber and into the groove of the opposite puller bar. Tighten down the clamping knobs. Press the green \"PULL\" button on the keypad to pull the needle using Program 0. The program should loop only once and finish at the last line of the program (Line 3). If it finishes early, try pulling a needle once or twice more to warm up the machine. Making the DNA Solution A few notes: All plasmid DNA to be injected should be suspended in distilled water. The final concentration of plasmid DNA should be 100 ng/\u03bcL Generally our receptor transgenes are injected at 30-50 ng/\u03bcL Co-injection markers are typically 5-15 ng/\u03bcL (except rol-6(su1006) which needs to be >50 ng/\u03bcL) use pPD95.75 to achieve a final concentration of 100 ng/\u03bcL Possible co-injection markers: myo-2p::GFP (5 ng/\u03bcL) unc-122p::GFP (aka coel::GFP ) pRF4 ( rol-6(su1006) ) - we have this genetype in pjCeKC10 Setting up the scope, loading the needle, mounting, and breaking the needle Set up the scope We use a Zeiss AX10 microscope with 10X and 40X objectives. Mounted on the scope is a Narishige micromanipulator. Pressure is generated by an Eppendor FemtoJet and an air compressor. Turn on the microscope using the wheel button to the right of the body. Turn on the air compressor (on the floor) by switching the switch from \"OFF\" to \"AUTO\". The FemtoJet can handle pressures no more than 120 psi so ensure the air compressor's pressure gauge is set below that. Turn on the Eppendorf FemtoJet (on the table, next to the microscope) using the switch on the back right. The pressure should be set to: Pi is set to ~600-1800 hPa (injection pressure - depends on how large the needle broke- if the tip is very small, use a higher pressure to ensure you are injecting enough volume, if it is large, use a smaller pressure so you don't load too much volume into the worm and kill it); it will take some practice to know what works best for you. Pc is set to 180 hPa (compensation pressure). This will also change depending on how large the tip has been broken (larger tip = smaller Pc, don't go lower than ~70 hPa). The foot pedal is set to inject when depressed (time is blank on screen). It will stop when released. If the needle gets clogged, you can use the clean button to blast high pressure through the needle. Refer to \"InjectionRigPreparation.pdf\" in Protocols/Microinjection for more instructions on set-up, shut down, and maintenance of the air compressor and the FemtoJet. Loading the needle Before loading the needle, add a very small amount of green food coloring to the DNA and centrifuge the DNA solution for 10 minutes at maximum speed to pellet particulate matter that might clog the needle. While the solution is spinning, take Drummond Scientific 10 \u03bcL calibrated glass pipette and pull it out to a fine tip over a Bunsen burner (about \u2155 is original thickness). This step takes a little practice. Break the end of the pulled out pipette. Once the spin is done, use the mouth aspirator and your pulled pipette to aspirate a tiny amount of DNA solution. Insert the tip into the pulled needle and puff out a little bit of DNA solution into the needle. Put the needle in a large petri dish with a strip of clay running down the dish with grooves in it for the needles, and wait 2-3 min. for the DNA solution to move to the tip via capillary action. Examine the needles under a dissecting microscope to ensure that none have particles or bubbles in the tip (these will clog the needle). Bubbles sometimes clear from the tip. OR Use a pipette to pipette DNA into the back of the needle. Wait 2-3 minutes for the DNA solution to move to the tip via capillary action. Mount the needle on the scope Press menu/enter on the FemtoJet. Press menu/enter again on the \"change capillary\" option (do this only if you are replacing a clogged/broken needle during use). Remove the old needle by unscrewing the clear grip head assembly that holds the needle. Insert your needle with the back end first so as not to break the tip. Make sure about 1 cm of the needles comes out past the back of the needle holder head. Tighten the needle by screwing the assembly onto the manipulator arm. Ensure the needle is in the micromanipulator at an angle of ~15-30 degrees to the stage. Turn the three knobs on the fine and coarse control of the micromanipulator to the middle of their range. Using the course controls (knobs on the part of the micromanipulator mounted on the stage), move the needle tip left/right and forward/backward until it is just above the objective. You will see it glowing in the light shining down from the condenser. Breaking the needle Break a coverslip in half and put it onto a slide with the broken edge facing the needle. Place a drop of halocarbon oil on the broken edge of the slide. Focus on the edge of the broken coverslip with the halocarbon oil on it. Using the fine controls, carefully lower the injection needle towards the stage until it is in the same focal plane as the coverslip. At this low power, you can't see the actual tip, so you may have to try the 40X objective. Using the fine controls or the gliding stage (your preference), slowly move the injection needle along the edge of the coverslip to break the needle on a angle. Be VERY careful and gentle. The needle pulled using program 0 has very little leeway to be broken. Break a very tiny piece off to open the needle. Any larger and it will be too big to be used (as it will kill the worms). To check the needle, press the foot pedal to look for flow out of the needle. You should see rapid laminar flow out of the needle and back towards the shaft, but no flow out at resting pressure. If there is no flow when you press the pedal, the needle isn't broken. Try again. You will have to see by experience what the optimal flow rate is. You want to be able to flood the gonad in about 3 seconds of flow at Pi. When done breaking the needle, use the fine control to lift the needle up out of the oil in preparation for injection. Mounting worms on an injection pad Take out an agarose pad and breathe on it (about 1 long breath) to moisten it. If it is too dry, the worms will dry out and die - too wet and the worms won't stick well. Place a drop of halocarbon oil on the pad. Lay the coverslip on the top of an upside down lid of a small worm plate. The pad should be at about the same height as the worms on a plate so you don't have to focus around too much when switching back and forth. Place a small dot of halocarbon oil on a part of the worm plate with no bacteria. Pick some worms from the bacterial lawn to the oil. This just makes it easier to get the worms off the pick when transferring them to the agarose pad. Most people like to use the adults 24-36 hr. post-L4. These animals have large robust gonads. Using a worm pick with oil as glue, transfer adult hermaphrodites from the oil dot on the worm plate to the oil drop on the agarose pad. If there is still adhering bacteria, push the worms around in the oil with a pick until the bacteria come off. Use a strand of eyebrow hair taped to a glass pipette to orient the worm and stick it to the agarose pad. Note: As a beginner, stick a single animal on a pad. The trick is to stick the animals down in the same orientation so that each animal's vulva is pointed to the same side. You don't want the syncytial gonad to be on top or underneath the animal. When the animal is in the oil, the syncytial gonad is visible as two clear areas towards the anterior and posterior of the animal. To stick the animal right, wait until it is floating in the oil so that it's body flexures go sideways, not up and down, and pat the animal down on the agarose pad with your pick until it is stuck to the pad. Avoid storking or patting the animal on the head, which can kill it. Ideally, the animal will be fully immobilized except for its head, which will still be free and wiggling. the animals stick best when they first touch the pad. If you fail to stick them on the first try, the pad will not stick to the same part of the animal again. Practice sticking down a whole set of animals in a line in the same orientation for assembly line injecting. Once the animals are in the oil, work reasonably fast to get the procedure over with before the animals dehydrate (roughly 10 min.). Injection Raise the injection needle off of the stage to allow room to put the injection pad with worms on the floating stage. Using the 10X objective find the worm, make sure it is in the correct orientation (vulva away from the needle). You can move or rotate the entire stage to move the worm, although some like to move the coverslip itself. It is best to have the worm at a 45\u00b0 angle to the needle; this maximizes the path length for the needle inside the gonad, helping to make sure you get the tip in the gonad instead of going all the way through and out the other side. Carefully lower the needle into the focal plane with the fine adjuster. At this point, you only need to move the needle up and down with the micromanipulator; you always move the worm, not the needle, up/down left/right, by moving the whole stage. Change to the 40X objective and focus on a syncytial gonad arm. This structure looks like a sausage-shaped clear area surrounded by nice round nuclei. The clear area has tiny speckles (See Figure 1 below). Focus on the center of the gonad (in the Z plane) so that you see a nice row of nuclei on either side of the sausage. Using the fine adjuster, move the needle up/down until its very tip is in focus. Gently move the needle so that it is pressing against the worm at a point where the syncytial gonad is pressed up against the body wall, and so that the needle tip will end up inside the gonad after it penetrates the body wall. There are many techniques to penetrate the body wall and enter the gonad. Here are two: (1) use your right index finger to gently tap the micromanipulator on the little box with the ball joint in it (just above where the arm the needle is on is attached). This vibrates the needle a little so that it punctures the worm. (2) slowly move the floating stage until the needle presses up against the body wall. Push slightly harder to enter the gonad. Hopefully, the tip of the needle is in the gonad now. Press the pedal to start the flow of DNA solution. If you're in the gonad it should be obvious; as the gonad is flooded it bloats like you're filling a sausage, and you can sometimes see the nuclei in the syncytium reacting to the flow. You want to put as much liquid in the gonad as possible; hopefully it will flow all the way around turn of the gonad. You will be able to see the green dye filling the gonad. A good rule of thumb is to inject until you see a good amount of liquid has made the turn and has flowed into the proximal gonad, and then shut off the flow. To stop the flow press the pedal again and move the animal away to get the needle out. Mello et al. (EMBO J. 10:3959-3970, 1991) show excellent photographs of a gonadal flood. Note: Usually one gonad arm is much easier to see than the other, so some people only inject the easy gonad arm. Others try to inject both. If you miss the gonad, you will see green liquid filling the pseudocoelom. Usually, the animal will survive, and you can just try again. It is surprisingly hard to kill the worm by jabbing and injecting it incorrectly. After you finish a worm, use the fine controls to lift the needle out of the oil before moving the stage to find a new worm, or removing the pad. Note: Eventually needles tend to clog and must be changed. Recovery Put the pad under the dissecting scope (on the inverted plate lid) and using a mouth pipette place a drop of recovery buffer on the worm. This action will form a channel, and the recovery buffer will form a layer underneath the oil in which the worm will float. Mouth pipette the worms in recovery buffer onto a fresh plate. Note: I put six worms (from the same injection) onto the same plate. Results Three to four days later, score the progeny of the injected worms for the co-injection marker phenotype. Each animal in the F 1 is considered an independent transformant (even if they come from the same injected P 0 ). Therefore, each F 1 should be picked to a different plate to try to get independent lines. Three days after picking individual F 1 transformants, check the plates to see if these have transmitted the co-injection marker to the next generation at a high rate (ideally, up to 90-100% of progeny for really good injections, but over 50% can be good enough for some strains). Continue to propagate these plates to the F2 generation and beyond (to ensure they don't suddenly lose the marker). Perform lysis reactions and PCRs to check for the desired transgenes in these lines. Once confirmed via PCR, pick the three highest transmitted independent lines to freeze and name with the lab naming convention \"ZAM#\". Chunk from the F2 plates (we want to freeze strains at the \"earliest\" point of their birth). Note: Typically, people inject 10-20 P 0 's, and you should expect to get 0-300 F 1 transformants. Of the F 1 transformants, typically about 5-70% will transmit the array, allowing a line to be established. These lines transmit the array to 30-100% of their progeny. There is variation among lines transformed with the same DNA. For example, only a fraction of lines transformed with a cosmid/co-injection marker might give rescue of a mutant phenotype, and the strength of the rescue (the penetrance and/or expressivity) will vary among lines that show rescue. For a conservative analysis of gene function, one should look at six lines before they tentatively believe any result. Additionally, GFP fusion constructs can be used to identify the tissue or cell where your favorite gene is expressed. Transgene arrays are composed of concatemers of whatever was injected in random order, orientation, and composition. For example, transgenes can combine the co-injection marker promoter to GFP. Be careful when interpreting transgenic lines, either rescue or expression. Some lines transmit at only a few percent per generation. The frequency of transmission varies from animal to animal. Keep lines with low transmission, as they are more useful than high transmitting lines for integrating the transgene (integration creates 100% transmission). Also, transmission, rescue, and expression from some transgenes change over time, likely due to changes in chromatin structure.","title":"Microinjection"},{"location":"protocols/Microinjection/Ce_Microinjection/Ce_Microinjection/#microinjection","text":"History: Protocol adapted from Michael Koelle (08/23/94), edited by Erik Andersen (08/10/09), Troy Meikle (04/24/18), and Kathy Vaccaro (03/09/20).

Turn on the air compressor (on the floor) by switching the switch from \"OFF\" to \"AUTO\". The FemtoJet can handle pressures no more than 120 psi so ensure the air compressor's pressure gauge is set below that. Turn on the Eppendorf FemtoJet (on the table, next to the microscope) using the switch on the back right. The pressure should be set to: Pi is set to ~600-1800 hPa (injection pressure - depends on how large the needle broke- if the tip is very small, use a higher pressure to ensure you are injecting enough volume, if it is large, use a smaller pressure so you don't load too much volume into the worm and kill it); it will take some practice to know what works best for you.

At this low power, you can't see the actual tip, so you may have to try the 40X objective. Using the fine controls or the gliding stage (your preference), slowly move the injection needle along the edge of the coverslip to break the needle on a angle. Be VERY careful and gentle. The needle pulled using program 0 has very little leeway to be broken. Break a very tiny piece off to open the needle. Any larger and it will be too big to be used (as it will kill the worms). To check the needle, press the foot pedal to look for flow out of the needle. You should see rapid laminar flow out of the needle and back towards the shaft, but no flow out at resting pressure. If there is no flow when you press the pedal, the needle isn't broken. Try again. You will have to see by experience what the optimal flow rate is. You want to be able to flood the gonad in about 3 seconds of flow at Pi. When done breaking the needle, use the fine control to lift the needle up out of the oil in preparation for injection.","title":"Breaking the needle"},{"location":"protocols/Microinjection/Ce_Microinjection/Ce_Microinjection/#mounting-worms-on-an-injection-pad","text":"Take out an agarose pad and breathe on it (about 1 long breath) to moisten it. If it is too dry, the worms will dry out and die - too wet and the worms won't stick well. Place a drop of halocarbon oil on the pad. Lay the coverslip on the top of an upside down lid of a small worm plate. The pad should be at about the same height as the worms on a plate so you don't have to focus around too much when switching back and forth. Place a small dot of halocarbon oil on a part of the worm plate with no bacteria. Pick some worms from the bacterial lawn to the oil. This just makes it easier to get the worms off the pick when transferring them to the agarose pad. Most people like to use the adults 24-36 hr. post-L4. These animals have large robust gonads. Using a worm pick with oil as glue, transfer adult hermaphrodites from the oil dot on the worm plate to the oil drop on the agarose pad. If there is still adhering bacteria, push the worms around in the oil with a pick until the bacteria come off. Use a strand of eyebrow hair taped to a glass pipette to orient the worm and stick it to the agarose pad. Note: As a beginner, stick a single animal on a pad. The trick is to stick the animals down in the same orientation so that each animal's vulva is pointed to the same side. You don't want the syncytial gonad to be on top or underneath the animal. When the animal is in the oil, the syncytial gonad is visible as two clear areas towards the anterior and posterior of the animal. To stick the animal right, wait until it is floating in the oil so that it's body flexures go sideways, not up and down, and pat the animal down on the agarose pad with your pick until it is stuck to the pad. Avoid storking or patting the animal on the head, which can kill it. Ideally, the animal will be fully immobilized except for its head, which will still be free and wiggling. the animals stick best when they first touch the pad. If you fail to stick them on the first try, the pad will not stick to the same part of the animal again. Practice sticking down a whole set of animals in a line in the same orientation for assembly line injecting. Once the animals are in the oil, work reasonably fast to get the procedure over with before the animals dehydrate (roughly 10 min.).","title":"Mounting worms on an injection pad"},{"location":"protocols/Microinjection/Ce_Microinjection/Ce_Microinjection/#injection","text":"Raise the injection needle off of the stage to allow room to put the injection pad with worms on the floating stage. Using the 10X objective find the worm, make sure it is in the correct orientation (vulva away from the needle). You can move or rotate the entire stage to move the worm, although some like to move the coverslip itself. It is best to have the worm at a 45\u00b0 angle to the needle; this maximizes the path length for the needle inside the gonad, helping to make sure you get the tip in the gonad instead of going all the way through and out the other side. Carefully lower the needle into the focal plane with the fine adjuster. At this point, you only need to move the needle up and down with the micromanipulator; you always move the worm, not the needle, up/down left/right, by moving the whole stage. Change to the 40X objective and focus on a syncytial gonad arm. This structure looks like a sausage-shaped clear area surrounded by nice round nuclei. The clear area has tiny speckles (See Figure 1 below). Focus on the center of the gonad (in the Z plane) so that you see a nice row of nuclei on either side of the sausage. Using the fine adjuster, move the needle up/down until its very tip is in focus. Gently move the needle so that it is pressing against the worm at a point where the syncytial gonad is pressed up against the body wall, and so that the needle tip will end up inside the gonad after it penetrates the body wall. There are many techniques to penetrate the body wall and enter the gonad. Here are two: (1) use your right index finger to gently tap the micromanipulator on the little box with the ball joint in it (just above where the arm the needle is on is attached). This vibrates the needle a little so that it punctures the worm. (2) slowly move the floating stage until the needle presses up against the body wall. Push slightly harder to enter the gonad. Hopefully, the tip of the needle is in the gonad now. Press the pedal to start the flow of DNA solution. If you're in the gonad it should be obvious; as the gonad is flooded it bloats like you're filling a sausage, and you can sometimes see the nuclei in the syncytium reacting to the flow. You want to put as much liquid in the gonad as possible; hopefully it will flow all the way around turn of the gonad. You will be able to see the green dye filling the gonad. A good rule of thumb is to inject until you see a good amount of liquid has made the turn and has flowed into the proximal gonad, and then shut off the flow. To stop the flow press the pedal again and move the animal away to get the needle out. Mello et al. (EMBO J. 10:3959-3970, 1991) show excellent photographs of a gonadal flood. Note: Usually one gonad arm is much easier to see than the other, so some people only inject the easy gonad arm. Others try to inject both. If you miss the gonad, you will see green liquid filling the pseudocoelom. Usually, the animal will survive, and you can just try again. It is surprisingly hard to kill the worm by jabbing and injecting it incorrectly. After you finish a worm, use the fine controls to lift the needle out of the oil before moving the stage to find a new worm, or removing the pad. Note: Eventually needles tend to clog and must be changed.","title":"Injection"},{"location":"protocols/Microinjection/Ce_Microinjection/Ce_Microinjection/#recovery","text":"Put the pad under the dissecting scope (on the inverted plate lid) and using a mouth pipette place a drop of recovery buffer on the worm.

Note: I put six worms (from the same injection) onto the same plate.","title":"Recovery"},{"location":"protocols/Microinjection/Ce_Microinjection/Ce_Microinjection/#results","text":"Three to four days later, score the progeny of the injected worms for the co-injection marker phenotype. Each animal in the F 1 is considered an independent transformant (even if they come from the same injected P 0 ). Therefore, each F 1 should be picked to a different plate to try to get independent lines. Three days after picking individual F 1 transformants, check the plates to see if these have transmitted the co-injection marker to the next generation at a high rate (ideally, up to 90-100% of progeny for really good injections, but over 50% can be good enough for some strains). Continue to propagate these plates to the F2 generation and beyond (to ensure they don't suddenly lose the marker). Perform lysis reactions and PCRs to check for the desired transgenes in these lines. Once confirmed via PCR, pick the three highest transmitted independent lines to freeze and name with the lab naming convention \"ZAM#\". Chunk from the F2 plates (we want to freeze strains at the \"earliest\" point of their birth). Note: Typically, people inject 10-20 P 0 's, and you should expect to get 0-300 F 1 transformants. Of the F 1 transformants, typically about 5-70% will transmit the array, allowing a line to be established. These lines transmit the array to 30-100% of their progeny. There is variation among lines transformed with the same DNA. For example, only a fraction of lines transformed with a cosmid/co-injection marker might give rescue of a mutant phenotype, and the strength of the rescue (the penetrance and/or expressivity) will vary among lines that show rescue. For a conservative analysis of gene function, one should look at six lines before they tentatively believe any result. Additionally, GFP fusion constructs can be used to identify the tissue or cell where your favorite gene is expressed. Transgene arrays are composed of concatemers of whatever was injected in random order, orientation, and composition. For example, transgenes can combine the co-injection marker promoter to GFP. Be careful when interpreting transgenic lines, either rescue or expression. Some lines transmit at only a few percent per generation. The frequency of transmission varies from animal to animal. Keep lines with low transmission, as they are more useful than high transmitting lines for integrating the transgene (integration creates 100% transmission). Also, transmission, rescue, and expression from some transgenes change over time, likely due to changes in chromatin structure.","title":"Results"},{"location":"protocols/Microinjection/Injection_Rig_Preparation/Injection_Rig_Preparation/","text":"Injection Rig Preparation Compressor Adapted from Panther Air Compressor Turn the knob on the automatic ON/OFF - Pressure Switch to the ON position.

If you choose Restriction Digest, select the 5\u2019 and 3\u2019 restriction sites you will be using. d. Click Add. Click NEW FRAGMENT. It is likely that you will be generating the rest of your fragments via PCR. If this is the case, paste in only the sequence to be amplified . Give the sequence a name and check \"Autogenerate primers.\" Click Add. Repeat step 5 for as many fragments as necessary. When finished, the Build page should look something like below: Now you can choose to add spacers or cut sites in between each fragment. Click the pencil icon (edit) on the backbone vector (in this case, pPD95.75). Select whether or not you want to regenerate the restriction sites. Generally, \"Min\" is the best choice, but be careful not to change the reading frame if you are assembling a fusion protein. Repeat step 7 if you want to add spacers between other fragments (i.e., you want to generate new cut sites between fragments). Click Done to get the final assembly. Copy the \"Assembled Color-coded Sequence\" and import it into Benchling for markup and annotation. Ensure the sequence is what you expect it to be and that the junctions between fragments aren't generating new cut sites or abolishing the cut sites you wanted to retain. If all is satisfactory, order the designed oligos. Be sure to include the 3\u2032 Tm and 3\u2032 Ta temperatures, as the 3\u2019 Ta will be used for the PCRs that generate the fragment. Assembly reactions Prior to assembly, generate all the fragments to be assembled - this may be by either synthesis, restriction digest of a plasmid, or PCR. Things to note: Restriction digest: ensure the digest completed by running an aliquot on a gel. In our experience, you do NOT need to gel purify the correct sized band - the off-target band will not impede the assembly. However, you DO need to inactivate the restriction enzymes. Some NEB enzymes can be heat inactivated at 65\u00b0C for 20 minutes, but check the specifications of the enzymes to be used. If you can\u2019t heat inactivate, you will need to purify using the PCR purification kit. PCR: use a high-fidelity polymerase from NEB, typically Q5. The polymerase you choose should correspond to the polymerase you selected when using the NEBuilder Assembly Tool. For these PCR reactions, do 25 \u03bcL reactions for 35 cycles, and use the Tm that the Assembly Tool provided (3\u2019 Ta). If the combined PCR products make up greater than \u2155 of the final assembly reaction, you should purify the PCR reactions. In general, it\u2019s probably better to purify. Thaw the reaction constituents on ice. Use the Qubit dsDNA BR kit to quantify every fragment. Calculate the molar amount of each fragment to include. See the HiFi assembly manual for details on this calculation, which will change depending on the number for fragments being assembled. Use the NEB Calculator for mass to moles conversions. Here is an example of two recent reactions: Fragment Ratio Assembly #1 Assembly #2 Vector backbone 50 ng 3500 bp (XbaI/EcoRI pPD95.75 fragment) = 0.023 pmol 3500 bp (XbaI/EcoRI pPD95.75 fragment) = 0.023 pmol Fragment 2 2:1 Insert:Vector Molar Ratio 0.046 pmol = 46.76 ng of 1645 bp cel-osm-9p 0.046 pmol = 89.23 ng of 3139 bp cel-tax-4p Fragment 3 2:1 Insert:Vector Molar Ratio 0.046 pmol = 79.79 ng of 2807 bma-osm-9 0.046 pmol = 44.43 ng of 1563 bp bma-tax-4 Total 0.03-0.2 pmols 0.115 pmol 0.115 pmol In this case, we start with 50 ng of the backbone and calculated the number of pmols that would be based on the size of the cut fragment that would be assembled. Multiply that amount (0.023 pmol) by two to get the 2:1 vector:insert ratio. 0.046 pmol of the 1645 bp cel-osm-9p is 46.76 ng. Using the calculated ng of each fragment and the measured concentration from the Qubit, calculate the volume to be added for a final volume of 5 \u03bcL ( Note : this is less than the final volume given in the NEB manual, in order to save reagents.) In other words, perform the calculations as recommended in the manual, and then divide all the constituents by 4. Assemble the final reaction in a PCR tube. a.

Things to note: Restriction digest: ensure the digest completed by running an aliquot on a gel. In our experience, you do NOT need to gel purify the correct sized band - the off-target band will not impede the assembly. However, you DO need to inactivate the restriction enzymes. Some NEB enzymes can be heat inactivated at 65\u00b0C for 20 minutes, but check the specifications of the enzymes to be used. If you can\u2019t heat inactivate, you will need to purify using the PCR purification kit. PCR: use a high-fidelity polymerase from NEB, typically Q5. The polymerase you choose should correspond to the polymerase you selected when using the NEBuilder Assembly Tool. For these PCR reactions, do 25 \u03bcL reactions for 35 cycles, and use the Tm that the Assembly Tool provided (3\u2019 Ta). If the combined PCR products make up greater than \u2155 of the final assembly reaction, you should purify the PCR reactions. In general, it\u2019s probably better to purify. Thaw the reaction constituents on ice. Use the Qubit dsDNA BR kit to quantify every fragment. Calculate the molar amount of each fragment to include. See the HiFi assembly manual for details on this calculation, which will change depending on the number for fragments being assembled. Use the NEB Calculator for mass to moles conversions. Here is an example of two recent reactions: Fragment Ratio Assembly #1 Assembly #2 Vector backbone 50 ng 3500 bp (XbaI/EcoRI pPD95.75 fragment) = 0.023 pmol 3500 bp (XbaI/EcoRI pPD95.75 fragment) = 0.023 pmol Fragment 2 2:1 Insert:Vector Molar Ratio 0.046 pmol = 46.76 ng of 1645 bp cel-osm-9p 0.046 pmol = 89.23 ng of 3139 bp cel-tax-4p Fragment 3 2:1 Insert:Vector Molar Ratio 0.046 pmol = 79.79 ng of 2807 bma-osm-9 0.046 pmol = 44.43 ng of 1563 bp bma-tax-4 Total 0.03-0.2 pmols 0.115 pmol 0.115 pmol In this case, we start with 50 ng of the backbone and calculated the number of pmols that would be based on the size of the cut fragment that would be assembled. Multiply that amount (0.023 pmol) by two to get the 2:1 vector:insert ratio. 0.046 pmol of the 1645 bp cel-osm-9p is 46.76 ng. Using the calculated ng of each fragment and the measured concentration from the Qubit, calculate the volume to be added for a final volume of 5 \u03bcL ( Note : this is less than the final volume given in the NEB manual, in order to save reagents.) In other words, perform the calculations as recommended in the manual, and then divide all the constituents by 4. Assemble the final reaction in a PCR tube. a.

When taking tube out of centrifuge, if the top layer turns slightly opaque, that is a good indication of a successful IVT reaction. To aqueous dsRNA, add ~500 \u00b5L isopropanol. Optional: Add 0.1 volume of 3M sodium acetate and 2-3 volumes of cold 100% EtOH. Place tube at -80\u00baC for 30 min. Spin at 15,000 x g for 15 min. at 4\u00baC. You should see pellet after centrifugation (gelatinous blob). Remove supernatant. Wash pellet with ~600 \u00b5L cold 70% ethanol. Spin at 5,000 x g for 5 min. at 4\u00baC. Optional: Wash again if the pellet appears salty (white instead of clear). Remove ~500 \u00b5L of supernatant, briefly spin in the minicentifuge. Use p20 remove as much of the supernatant as possible. Briefly spin in minicentrifuge. Use p2.5 remove the remaining supernatant. You can use the p2.5 tip to move the gelatinous pellet up the side of the tube to facilitate drying and collect any remaining supernatant that is in tube. Air dry, and resuspend in RNase-free water at a volume of 1-2 \u00b5g/\u00b5L. Note: If pellet is at bottom etching = 100 \u00b5g. Visible pellets form when there is 5 \u00b5g of dsRNA. When you add water, the pellet will fall into solution and begin to zip around the top of the water until it goes into solution. If it doesn't, this means there may be too much salt in your RNA, or there is no RNA present. Make a 1:10 dilution of original product by taking 1 \u00b5L dsRNA and 9 \u00b5L nuclease-free water. This will be used for a gel and to asses amount and purity of dsRNA using Nanodrop.

Follow the the RNA extraction protocol for C. elegans or parasites . Use the Invitrogen SuperScript III kit to perform first-strand cDNA synthesis. Do not freeze RNA in between extraction and first-strand synthesis; perform synthesis immediately after quantification. Include a non-experimental RNA sample that comes from the same species and stage as your experimental samples (I typically use stock RNA samples from the FR3). If performing relative transcript quantification, be sure to normalize the RNA input based on the Qubit quantification. Use a 1:1 mixture of oligo(dT) and random hexamer primers and create primer and enzyme master mixes to use across all samples. Perform the optional RNase H digestion to remove remaining single-stranded RNAs. Freeze at -20\u00b0C until ready for the qPCR. Before optimizing your primers, validate that they work and produce the expected amplicon length by performing normal PCR on a plasmid template and/or cDNA template. Book the qPCR machine on the morning of the reaction. Primer optimization Primer stock dilutions qPCR primers must be optimized for each new RNA/cDNA template. Primer optimization involves primer dilutions to find the optimal primer concentration for each primer set + template combination. Depending on your experiments, you should probably use the same stage, non-experimental cDNA sample that is at the same concentration as your experimental samples (the best practice is to include this sample in your cDNA synthesis reaction). The PowerUp SYBR Green Master Mix kit recommends trying 300, 500, and 800 nM final concentrations, but you can add additional (lower) concentrations as well.

Use the table below to calculate primer dilutions required to achieve final primer concentrations of 300, 500, and 800 nM in your eventual 20 \u03bcL qPCR reactions. Dilute the volume of 10 \u03bcM primer stock shown below in bold to a final volume of 50 \u03bcL in water.

If possible, each primer dilution should be run in duplicate. Ideally, use a non-experimental cDNA sample that has the same concentration and is from the same life stage as your experimental samples. Design the plate setup on Benchling (example below). a. If possible, do not add any reactions to the outer columns or rows to ensure no evaporation (though I have not run into evaporation problems regardless of well location). b. Keep the same primers next to each other on the plate. c. Be sure to include no-template negative controls to check for contamination in your primer stocks. Dilute an aliquot of the cDNA to 2.5 ng \u03bcL so that 2 \u03bcL input cDNA will make 5ng/qPCR (or dilute to half of the final mass so that you can add 2 \u03bcL to the reaction). Create primer + PowerUp SYBR Green master mixes by adding 10 \u03bcL PowerUp SYBR Green * (n + 1) + 8 \u03bcL primer dilution * (n + 1) to a single tube (one master mix per primer dilution). Put a qPCR plate on ice. Pipette 2 \u03bcL of the proper cDNA to the side wall of the well. a. This makes it easier to keep track of which well has had the cDNA added. b. Another strategy for keeping track of pipetting is arranging your pipette tip box such that you know exactly which tip will be the last one to be used. Add 18 \u03bcL of the proper master mix to the dot of cDNA and allows the mixture to fall to the bottom of the tube. Carefully seal the plate with sealing film. Spin the plate on the plate centrifuge. Examine the bottom of each well to ensure no bubbles remain. If there are bubbles, sharply flick the well until it pops. Respin the plate if necessary. Return the plate to ice and move to the qPCR machine in room 311. Thermocycler setup Touch the screen of the thermocycler to wake it up and press the on/off button to turn it on.

Before defining no-template negative controls in the plate layout (in this case, wells C1 and D1), click the \u201cN\u201d box in the Task section. Click the \u201cRun Method\u201d menu. a. Setup the thermocycler program according to the below screenshot. Changes that need to be made from the default program: i. A 2 minute, 50\u00b0C hold step needs to be added before the 95\u00b0 hold step in the Holding Stage. ii. The 95\u00b0 hold step should be changed to 2 minutes. iii. Based on your primers, you probably need to add a 3 rd step to the Cycling Stage. Adjust the 2 nd step to 15 seconds and the annealing temperature validated with the initial PCR used to test the primers on plasmid/cDNA template. Add a 3 rd step with a 1 minute, 72\u00b0C extension. Deselect the \u201cData Collection\u201d icon on the annealing step and select it on the extension step. iv.

Analysis of the melt curves will tell you if your primers are forming primer dimers or are amplifying off-target sequences. In order to continue with the qPCR experiment, your primer should include a single peak in the Derivative plot, corresponding to a single amplicon produced by the reaction. Primer dimers will correspond to peaks at low temperatures, and longer non-off target products will correspond to peaks at higher temperatures. d. Negative controls will not have a peak (because there should be no amplification). You will notice from the above plot that the negative controls for GAPDH and OSM-9 were correct, while it appears that there was contamination in the TAX-4 primers (every line contains a peak). Examine the plot in amplification.pdf (right). a. Again there will be a row for every target and a column for dRn and log10(dRn) b. In the dRn column, you should see a label and line marking each of the primer dilutions you included, along with the C T value. The dilution with the lowest C T , in this case 800 for all primer sets, should be used in qPCR using experimental samples. qPCR with experimental samples Based on the results of the primer optimization, create new primer dilutions at the optimized concentrations, this time ensuring you make enough of the qPCR primer stock for all of the reactions (use the tables above). Follow the Plate setup and Thermocycler setup sections above. a. When organizing the plate in Thermocycler setup step 6, use your different cDNAs instead of primer dilutions as the Sample Names. b. Run the exact same thermocyler program as you ran for primer optimization. qPCR analysis Follow steps 1 - 4 from Primer optimization analysis to export the reaction results as described. Transfer qpcr_analysis.R to the folder containing the data. Open qpcr_analysis.R in RStudio. Run lines 1 - 95 to create amplification.pdf and melt_curves.pdf . Examine the resulting images to check for on-target amplification and proper results for the negative controls. Run lines 100 - 127 to plot the C T values for each sample (using the mean from technical replicates).

The tail will be slightly curved, whilst the head will be straighter and rounder. Clean all cryomolds, tools, and working surfaces with Eliminase prior to the embedding process. Embed twice the number of specimens as needed as this approach is prone to error considering the number of steps and precision required from sectioning to RNA extraction. How to Orient and Image Nematodes for Downstream Spatial Sectioning Embedding Parasite Staining In a 10 cm Petri dish, make a 1:5 dilution of 0.05% methylene blue in RPMI and mix with a pipette tip (100 \u00b5L of 0.05% methylene blue in 400 \u00b5L RPMI is typically used for Brugia adults and L3/L4 from all species). Prepare 3 or 4 100 \u00b5L pools of RPMI in the Petri dish. These pools will be used to perform a serial wash the L3/L4 or adults after the staining to remove excess methylene blue. For L3 and L4: Take a group of L3 in a volume of 20 \u00b5L using a p20 pipette from a pool of washed L3 and drop them in the pool of diluted methylene blue. For adults: Using a worm hook, take one adult at a time from a culture plate containing sorted/washed adults and transfer to the pool of diluted methylene blue. Allow parasites to soak for two to five minutes. Monitor the colour change using the scope. You may need to add time if not stained completely. Whilst the parasites are staining, prepare the dry ice for embedding: a. Align the dry ice in a cover from a pipette tip box as evenly as possible. b. Use one of the metallic cryomolds to shape the ice to the cryomold so it does not slide around whilst imaging. Parasite Embedding Once L3/L4 or adults are in their final serial rinse, add enough OCT so that it comes up to the first lip of a room temperature cryomold. Once OCT is added, place the cryomold on the dry ice. Ensure that the imaging software is configured in the appropriate way for your experiment, and that the camera is working and the cryomold and expected area of imaging is in focus. Setup a folder with the experiment date, into which the images from embedding will be saved. Save images as .bmp files. L3 and L4: Pipette L3/L4 from the final wash in a volume of 2.5 \u00b5L and set to the side. Aspirate 1 \u00b5L of 0.05% methylene blue using a pipette and set to the side. Add the 2.5 \u00b5L of L3/L4 to the surface of the OCT in the cryomold. With a micro-needle, untangle/uncoil the L3/L4 as quickly as possible. Separate one L3/L4 from the group of parasites in OCT and move to an open area of the cryomold where you aim to image the embedding process. Manipulate the worm to get it as straight as possible. Add a blue dot using the previously pipetted methylene blue on each side of the L3/L4, and then add a second dot above or below the dot next to the head (used for orientation when it comes time for measuring and cryosectioning). Note: You will not be able to see the L3/L4 in the OCT until the bottom of the OCT/cryomold freezes. Adults: Aspirate 1 \u00b5L of 0.05% methylene blue using a pipette and set to the side. Using a worm hook, transfer the adult from the final wash pool to the surface of the OCT in the cryomold. With a micro-needle, untangle/uncoil the adult as quickly as possible. Manipulate the worm and move the head so that it is pointing toward the right edge of the cryomold. Try to get the head as straight and parallel to the horizon as possible. Make sure the head is not overlapping with any other part of the body. Add a blue dot next to the head of using the previously pipetted methylene blue. Before the worm completely freezes, take pictures every three seconds. Record the magnification and imaging data used to capture the image. You will have 45 seconds between placing cryomold on the dry ice and complete OCT block freezing. Once the OCT block completely freezes, remove the cryomold from dry ice. Remove the dry ice block from the cryomold. Wrap in a piece of parafilm. On a paper label, add the date, stage, species, and sample number. Place this label on top of the parafilm-wrapped OCT block. Wrap both in a larger piece of parafilm and twist the corners together to close. Place the sample in the -80\u00baC until ready to be used for cryosectioning. Repeat the above steps until an appropriate number of adults have been embedded. Measuring Distances for Cryosectioning Note: Organise images in a logical way on the desktop of the imaging computer. Once images are organised, move the images to your personal folder in Box. Once all measurement data has been recorded, keep the images in your Box folder, but remove the images from the imaging desktop. Open Fiji and the Box folder containing your embedding images. Select the best image from the series of images you took from a single worm. The best image is one where the OCT is about to freeze over, but the dot and worm are still visible. Click and drag the image to the Fiji toolbar. This will open the image in the Fiji program. Click on the straight-line tool in the Fiji toolbar. Measure distances by placing the crosshairs of the mouse at your starting point, click and drag to your end point and release the mouse. This should create a solid yellow line, which will be your measurement line. If it is not accurate, repeat this process until satisfied. [img2] Click on the analysis button in the top toolbar. Select the measurement option. This will bring up a box with measurement data. Record the value under the Length heading. This value is in pixels. Repeat the above process until all essential measurements are recorded. Adult Measurements: - Start of dot to end of dot - End of dot to start of worm L3/L4 Measurements: - Distance between end of dot and start of head - Distance between end of dot and tail Random Embedding for Downstream in situ Applications Parasite Staining (Optional) Refer to the staining instructions above. Prepare Dry Ice Align the dry ice in a cover from a pipette tip box as evenly as possible. Use one of the metallic cryomolds to shape the ice to the cryomold so it does not slide around whilst imaging. Parasite Embedding (Jumbled) Note: Typically done with 2-5 Adult Parasites. Using a worm hook, transfer a group of 2-5 adults from the final wash pool (if staining) or from pre-washed and sorted adults (if not staining) to the surface of the OCT in the cryomold. With a micro-needle, manipulate the adult as quickly as possible. Manipulate the worms so that the block cuts longitudinal sections. Before the worm complete freezes, take pictures every three seconds. Record the magnification and imaging data used to capture the image. You will have 45 seconds between placing cryomold on the dry ice and complete OCT block freezing. Once the OCT block completely freezes, remove cryomold from dry ice. Remove the dry ice block from the cryomold. Wrap in a piece of parafilm. On a paper label, add the date, stage, species, and sample number. Place this label on top of the parafilm-wrapped OCT block.

Prepare 3 or 4 100 \u00b5L pools of RPMI in the Petri dish. These pools will be used to perform a serial wash the L3/L4 or adults after the staining to remove excess methylene blue. For L3 and L4: Take a group of L3 in a volume of 20 \u00b5L using a p20 pipette from a pool of washed L3 and drop them in the pool of diluted methylene blue. For adults: Using a worm hook, take one adult at a time from a culture plate containing sorted/washed adults and transfer to the pool of diluted methylene blue. Allow parasites to soak for two to five minutes. Monitor the colour change using the scope. You may need to add time if not stained completely.

Transfer the rack containing the Pur-A-Lyzer tubes to this new beaker using sterile forceps. Place a new foil cover over the top of the beaker, and place back in the 37\u00baC + 5% CO 2 incubator. If the CM surrounding the tubes changes color, this is a sign of pH change, and the CM will need to be changed. Discard old CM and replace with sterile, pre-warmed CM. 72-hours Post-Soaking (Knock-down check) Remove the beaker from the incubator and move to BSC. Remove holder containing the tubes. Remove the cap from the Pur-A-Lyzer tube. Remove the parasites from the tubes using worm hooks. Wash the adults in a Petri dish containing sterile, pre-warmed RPMI amended with 1% (v/v) P/S. After washing, using worm hooks, transfer the adults to a sterile, labelled 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube. The adults should stick to the inside of the tube. Using a p1000 pipettor, quickly pipette 100 \u00b5L of sterile RPMI on the group of adults on the inside wall of the tube. This should draw all the adults to the bottom of the tube. A brief spin in a benchtop centrifuge can also help if adults have not been drawn to the bottom. Repeat the above steps until all desired groups of adult parasites have been washed and transferred to a sterile, labelled 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube. Snap freeze the tubes in liquid nitrogen. Store at -80\u00baC. Note: If time allows, perform RNA extraction immediately. Measure gene knock-down using qPCR protocol . RNAi Assay Optimization If significant transcript knock-down (> 50%) is not achieved within 72 hours, you can consider increasing dsRNA concentration, repeated exposure to dsRNAs (replenishing every other day), or increasing dsRNA exposure through extending the timeline of culture. If significant transcript knock-down (> 50%) is achieved, you will need to align the dynamics and timing of this knock-down to measuring your phenotypic endpoint(s) of interest.","title":"Dialysis Tube RNAi"},{"location":"protocols/Parasitic_Nematodes/Dialysis_Tube_RNAi/Dialysis_Tube_RNAi/#dialysis-tube-rnai","text":"","title":"Dialysis Tube RNAi"},{"location":"protocols/Parasitic_Nematodes/Dialysis_Tube_RNAi/Dialysis_Tube_RNAi/#materials","text":"Pur-A-Lyzer\u2122 Midi Dialysis Kit (Sigma Aldrich #PURD60050-1KT)","title":"Materials"},{"location":"protocols/Parasitic_Nematodes/Dialysis_Tube_RNAi/Dialysis_Tube_RNAi/#protocol","text":"Prepare gene-specific dsRNAs as described in the dsRNA synthesis protocol.

Ensure that all fields of the log are filled out in order for your request to be fulfilled in a timely and accurate manner. Mosquito orders are to be placed THREE WEEKS before they are needed for experimental use! Expect a minimum of 1 L3 per infected mosquito (more typically 5 Bp L3 per mosquito, 1-3 Di L3 per mosquito). Keep in mind that ~20% may not blood-feed and ~20-50% may die off before extraction, which is not uncommon with high parasite burden. Overestimate the number of mosquitoes you will need to account for death throughout the rearing process Standard mosquito orders are filled in the following quantities (can be adjusted according to your experimental needs): Small carton: 50 female LVP or 50 female AaSD Large carton: 1 carton/150 female LVP each or 4 cartons/350 female AaSD each You are responsible for maintaining the sucrose pads and monitoring the adult mosquito death for your cartons throughout the duration of use.

Collection of Egg Sheets Installing Egg Sheets/Cups (every Friday) Label brown paper with species, the date, and initials. Place brown paper in black egg cups that is labelled with the corresponding mosquito species tape color (pink: LVP, lime green: AaSD) so that it is tight against the cup walls with no bubbles. Fill cup half way with distilled water. Label cup with species tape. Place in back corner of the colony cage. Collecting Egg Sheets (every Monday) Take all black egg cups out of colony cages. Take out each egg sheet from black egg cups. Lay egg sheets out on paper towel and cover with another sheet of paper towel, to avoid contamination or egg laying by rogue mosquitoes. Place in a old larvae pan with a glass lid and place in the insectary chamber overnight. The egg paper should be almost completely dry (if too dry eggs fall off, but want dry enough so mold doesn\u2019t grow). Take off any dead adults from egg sheet (prevents microbial growth). Label a Whirlpak bag with species name, date that egg sheets were placed in the cages, and initials. Place Whirlpak bag in proper species storage container located within the large insectary. II. Hatching Eggs and Panning Larvae Hatching Mosquito Eggs Select an egg sheet to hatch that is roughly three weeks post collection. Cut off correct amount (make sure to wash scissors before and after cutting the egg sheet with 70% ethanol). Amount of egg sheet will depend on number of pans and density of eggs on the sheet selected. Use your best estimation. You can always hatch more. Record how much was hatched and the date it was hatched on the daily mosquito maintenance log. Place egg sheet in a \u201chatch jar\u201d that has DISTILLED water and has been autoclaved properly (aka jar top is popped) and ensure egg sheet is immersed in water. Once larvae have hatched, you can begin panning out larvae. Tips for hatching mosquito eggs: A. aegypti typically lay eggs quite densely on the sheet and you will therefore only need one strip of the egg sheet. Try to use the oldest egg sheets first, as the eggs hatch poorly after 3\u20136 months months. A. aegypti typically take 1 hr. to hatch out. If larvae do not hatch, you can try switching jars (taking out egg sheet and putting in new autoclaved jar). ONLY feed first instar larvae a few drops MAXIMUM of food (Tetramin slurry) as they will die with an excess of food. Panning Out Mosquito Larvae 24 hr. prior to panning larvae, obtain and set out clean and autoclaved larvae pans. Add 1.5 liters of distilled water to each pan. Label the pans with the correct color tape with the species, date on which larvae will be added to pans, and initials. Place a glass pan lid on top of pan. Obtain clean/new plastic pipette and a clicker-counter. Pipette up larvae and drop them into the clean, glass dish. Using a glass Pasteur pipette, count approximately 300 larvae into a plastic larvae cup. Once all larvae have been counted, dump one cup of 300 larvae per pan. Feed larvae a few drops of food slurry. Place pans on the appropriate labelled shelf in the large walk-in insectary. Tips for panning larvae: Before sucking larvae up into the pipette, suck up just distilled water to prevent larvae from sticking to the sides of the pipette. Pan out larvae as soon as possible, ideally 30 min to an hour after hatching. 300 larvae per pan is the optimal larval count for consistent and healthy larvae growth. III. Obtaining and Separating Pupae Picking pupae Obtain a carton (for experimental orders) or a clean, glass pupae dish (for the cage) and label with correct colored tape and todays date. Collect larvae pans and check for adequate pupation (> 75%). Fill up with distilled water (a little more than \u00bc the cup). Obtain a clean pupae picker. Pick pupae. Fill orders if needed or place directly into the cage. If placing in the cage, label the pupae dish using the appropriate colored tape (pink: LVP, lime green: AaSD) and include the following information on the label: species name, date, date of emergence (two days from the current date), number of pupae in the cup, and your initials. Use a new picker or clean currently used picker before switching to the next species. Make sure your picker is clean and no tiny larvae are on it. Tips for picking pupae: Clean picker thoroughly or use a new one to ensure you are not transferring larvae, pupae or eggs to other pans. Put only 50 females in experimental cups. Males pupate about a day or two before females pupate. Female pupae are generally larger than male pupae in Aedes spp.. Separating pupae using the glass separator Obtain the pan(s) of mosquito larvae/pupae that you want to separate. Obtain a couple large plastic beakers with handles and a metal strainer. Place a large pan under the separator. Fill one beaker with water and rinse and clean the separator by forcefully pouring water over each of the four knobs and down the main panel of the separator. Do this thrice to ensure the separator is clean and no contaminating larvae or pupae are caught in the separator. After cleaning, empty the water from the large catch pan. Dump the mosquito pan(s) into the metal strainer and drain the water out. Rinse the larvae/pupae down in the corner of the strainer with lukewarm tap water. Dump larvae/pupae into one of the beakers with minimal lukewarm water. Tighten the bottom nobs so that a water line from the bottom of the separator to about two to three inches up the separator glass panel (do not tighten them all the way). Do not tighten top nobs, they should be all the way loose. Carefully and slowly dump the beaker of larvae/pupae/distilled water down through the top of the separator between the two glass plates. Only pour a small number of pupae/larvae at a time. Now loosen both the bottom nobs a very small amount and use gentle hand pressure to pull the front glass panel away from the back-glass panel (this moves the mosquitoes down the separator and allows them to keep in a straight line). Pour the beaker of distilled water down through the top of the separator slowly until the mosquitoes are an even line. Loosen the nobs again evenly. Pour more distilled water down the top of the separator. Repeat steps 11 through 14 until you have separated out the larvae. Dump larvae back into the metal strainer/pan/cup for whatever purpose they are needed. If not needed, place in a paper cup and put in freezer. Replace pan under the separator. Continue steps 11 through 14 until you have separated out the male pupae (the smallest pupae, bottom line of pupae). Dump male pupae into the metal strainer/pan/cup for whatever purpose they are needed. Replace pan under separator and repeat steps 11-14 until you have separated out the female pupae (the largest pupae, top line of pupae). Dump female pupae into a large glass pupae dish (if counting for orders) or a regular sized pupae dish (if placing in the colony cage). Note: If placing pupae in the colony cage, label the pupae dish using the appropriate colored tape (pink: LVP, lime green: AaSD) and include the following information on the label: species name, date, date of emergence (two days from the current date), number of pupae in the cup, and your initials. Make sure to check and clean the separator thoroughly before and after use as pupae and larvae tend to get stuck in it and come out the sides of the glass (this is a possible way for contamination of pans and experimental cartons). IV. Filling Mosquito Orders Fill plastic dish or small mosquito carton \u00bc to \u00bd full of distilled water. Count out pupae into plastic dish or small mosquito carton. Note: ~50 pupae for both species go in small cartons. 150 LVP pupae or 350 AaSD pupae go into the large cartons. Place the plastic dish in a large mosquito carton or place a piece of mesh over a small carton and place a lid (rim of lid with the center removed) over the mesh. Label the cup properly including: species name, date, date of emergence, number of pupae in the cup, and your initials Place a sucrose pad on the top of the carton. Keep an organized, detailed order log for people to place orders. Keep a calendar that shows when orders are needed and also when to begin picking pupae to fill orders. Overestimate orders to account for deaths (usually by an extra 5\u201320 mosquitoes). Let people know a head of time if there is a chance that the order may not be filled on time or with as many mosquitoes as requested. V. Making Sucrose Pads How to make 10% sucrose solution Fill designated beaker to tape mark with sugar (200 g of sugar) Dump into large (2000 mL) beaker Fill beaker to the top with distilled water Mix sugar in thoroughly Transfer to a container with cap for long-term storage. How to make sucrose pads for cages Cut cotton square from cotton rolls (for colony cage or large cartons) or cotton balls (small cartons). Wear gloves to saturate cotton square in large beaker of sucrose solution. Obtain plastic Petri dish lid that will hold sucrose pad (large Petri dish for sucrose pads going on large cartons or colony cage or small Petri dish for sucrose pad going on small cartons). Fit sucrose pad to plastic Petri dish lid. Squeeze out excess sucrose solution so that it will not drip, but enough that it will also stay moist until the next day. Apply to top of the cage (flip pad after three days). Moisten sucrose pad everyday using sucrose bottle (stored in fridge) containing 10% sucrose solution. Moisten enough so the pad is wet but not dripping into the carton. Tips for sucrose pads: Change sucrose pads on cartons once or twice a week or when they turn brownish color. Wash sucrose bottle every so often as mold growth occurs in bottle. Change sucrose pads on cages and experimental cartons twice a week. VI. Mosquito Blood Feeding Starving Mosquitoes for Blood Feeding Starve colony cages and LVP cartons 24 hours in advance. Do not starve more than 24 hr., they will die. Starve AaSD experimental cartons less than 12 hr. prior to feeding. AaSD tend to die easily if starved too long. Blood Feeding Experimental (Parasite) Mosquito Cartons Follow Carton Assembly protocol for biosafety-compliant housing of infected mosquitoes. Follow Blood Feeding protocol to infect mosquitoes in cartons. Blood Feeding Colony Cages Colony cages are blood fed every week, alternating between rabbit feeding and the membrane system. VII. Colony Cage Maintenance Colony cages should be cleaned at least once a week. This is a must because dead mosquitoes at the bottom of the cage cause mites to occur and infest the cages. This also prevents mold growth were sucrose pads sit on the screen and other microbial growth. Colony cages should be switched out completely (new sleeve, screen and completely cleaned) once every 3\u20106 months. Starting a new cage: Make sure to check for cracks and holes very carefully. Use duct tape to tape around all the edges (bottom, top and sides). Use epoxy to fill any holes in the screen that are minor (do not use duct tape unless you tape both sides to prevent mosquitoes from sticking to the tape). Label the cage with the date it was established. Make mesh sleeve for accessibility when adding and removing pupae dishes and egg cups. Adding and removing pupae dishes: Once pupae are in pupae dish, open the mesh sleeve to the colony cage and place the pupae cup in the cage. Add a piece of mesh to cover the top of the pupae dish. Once the pupae dish has been situated and covered, knot the mesh sleeve to prevent mosquitoes from escaping the colony cage. Check the pupae dish every day and release the emerged adults, by removing the mesh and waving the mesh and lightly blowing on the pupae dish to disperse the adults into the cage. Once a majority of the adults have emerged (2-3 days after introducing the pupae dish), you can remove the pupae cup from the cage. To do so, remove the mesh from on top of the pupae dish. Place a small mosquito carton lid (used to fulfill orders) over the top of the cup. Quickly remove the dish from the cage through the mesh sleeve. Try to minimize the adults that escape from the cage throughout this process. Once the dish is removed and mesh sleeve is knotted, place the pupae cup in the freezer for 24-48 hours. VIII. Autoclaving Jars and Pans Autoclaving Hatch Jars Wash hatch jars thoroughly with soap and warm water. Rinse thoroughly with distilled water. Fill jars about \u00bd to \u2154 the way up with distilled water. Place a lid cover and band on jars. Place autoclave tape on the top of the lid cover. Note: Do not tighten jar lids completely. Make sure they are loose. Place in autoclave . Screw tops on tight immediately after they are taken out of the autoclave. Allow to cool completely before using to hatch larvae. Note: You know the jars have been sterilized properly and sealed correctly if they make a popping sound when you go to open them. If it does not pop, do not use and use a new jar. Autoclaving Larval Rearing Pans Wash pans thoroughly with unscented dish washing soap and rinse thoroughly with distilled water. Let pans dry completely. Stack pans no more than 14 high. Cover the bottom pan with foil so that none of the pans are exposed. Foil does not need to go all the way around the stack, just cover the entire bottom pan. Place autoclave tape on the foil covering the bottom pan. Place in autoclave . Allow pans to cool completely before use. IX. Insectary Cleaning Wash jars thoroughly to ensure there are no eggs or larvae left behind. Wash pans thoroughly to ensure there are no larvae or pupae left behind. Use all-natural unscented dish soap when you wash larvae pans. Wash plastic lids used for sucrose pads, larvae counting cups used for counting pans, and pupae dishes and hatch jars with normal dish soap. Ensure there are no eggs or larvae left behind in the hatch jars or larvae cups. Wash and re-use mesh and spline used for cage making. If there are small holes in the mesh, use epoxy to cover the holes. Sweep and mop the insectary space at least once every other week or as needed. Wipe down shelves in the insectary incubator every other week or as needed using all-natural unscented dish soap. Use gloves to clean colony cages. Vacuum out the dead mosquitoes from all the colony cages once a week (usually done right after blood feeding). Empty the vacuum once a month of as needed and clean off filter. Wipe down the inside bottom, inside edges and outside of cages with a towel and warm water. DO NOT use soap or cleaning products. X. Mosquito Rearing Troubleshooting Water Change out dirty water in pans. Use room temperature water if you notice death after cleaning out pans. Check the pH of the distilled water; sometimes this fluctuates. If pH is a problem you can use a large Nalgene container as a reservoir for water and treat with salt additive if necessary (has been done in the past). Sucrose Make sure they are not dripping causing pools of sucrose where mosquitoes can get stuck and die. Change sucrose pads to ensure there is no mold growth or that they were not made with salt. Change/ make new sucrose solution. Ensure no microbial growth is occurring in sucrose bottle or beaker. Tetramin feeding Make new Tetramin slurry. Spread the food out more in the pan. Vary the amounts (less or more). Use dry food for early instar stages (food stays near the top this way as do the early life stages). Humidity/temperature Add plastic around all edges of the cage (except where the sleeve is) to provide more humidity in the adult cage. Blood feeding When adult cage is failing to thrive or egg production is minimal, try blood feeding twice weekly with days in between so they can get sucrose meals (Tuesday and Friday blood feeding days). Hatching egg sheets If egg sheets fail to hatch, there are a few things to check: Age of the egg sheet. Egg sheets older than 6 months will hatch very little or none at all. They may also take up to a week to fully hatch out. Switching the egg sheet to a different jar has proven successful in the past. This could be because the first jar did not autoclave correctly or water is contaminated. Leaving the egg sheets overnight. If you have not seen larvae in the jar, leave it overnight. If they are not present the next day at all, hatch a new sheet.","title":"Insectary Operations"},{"location":"protocols/Parasitic_Nematodes/Insectary/Insectary/#insectary-operations","text":"This document describes insectary operations for the maintenance and infection of Aedes aegypti mosquito strains with filarial parasites. Aedes aegypti (LVP) is used for Brugia spp. infections Aedes aegypti (AaSD) is used for Dirofilaria infections Important General Notes: Orders should be placed on the experimental mosquito Order Log found in the mosquito order binder, which is located in the insectary. Ensure that all fields of the log are filled out in order for your request to be fulfilled in a timely and accurate manner. Mosquito orders are to be placed THREE WEEKS before they are needed for experimental use! Expect a minimum of 1 L3 per infected mosquito (more typically 5 Bp L3 per mosquito, 1-3 Di L3 per mosquito). Keep in mind that ~20% may not blood-feed and ~20-50% may die off before extraction, which is not uncommon with high parasite burden. Overestimate the number of mosquitoes you will need to account for death throughout the rearing process Standard mosquito orders are filled in the following quantities (can be adjusted according to your experimental needs): Small carton: 50 female LVP or 50 female AaSD Large carton: 1 carton/150 female LVP each or 4 cartons/350 female AaSD each You are responsible for maintaining the sucrose pads and monitoring the adult mosquito death for your cartons throughout the duration of use.

Cut off correct amount (make sure to wash scissors before and after cutting the egg sheet with 70% ethanol). Amount of egg sheet will depend on number of pans and density of eggs on the sheet selected. Use your best estimation. You can always hatch more. Record how much was hatched and the date it was hatched on the daily mosquito maintenance log. Place egg sheet in a \u201chatch jar\u201d that has DISTILLED water and has been autoclaved properly (aka jar top is popped) and ensure egg sheet is immersed in water. Once larvae have hatched, you can begin panning out larvae. Tips for hatching mosquito eggs: A. aegypti typically lay eggs quite densely on the sheet and you will therefore only need one strip of the egg sheet. Try to use the oldest egg sheets first, as the eggs hatch poorly after 3\u20136 months months. A. aegypti typically take 1 hr. to hatch out. If larvae do not hatch, you can try switching jars (taking out egg sheet and putting in new autoclaved jar). ONLY feed first instar larvae a few drops MAXIMUM of food (Tetramin slurry) as they will die with an excess of food. Panning Out Mosquito Larvae 24 hr. prior to panning larvae, obtain and set out clean and autoclaved larvae pans. Add 1.5 liters of distilled water to each pan. Label the pans with the correct color tape with the species, date on which larvae will be added to pans, and initials. Place a glass pan lid on top of pan. Obtain clean/new plastic pipette and a clicker-counter. Pipette up larvae and drop them into the clean, glass dish. Using a glass Pasteur pipette, count approximately 300 larvae into a plastic larvae cup. Once all larvae have been counted, dump one cup of 300 larvae per pan. Feed larvae a few drops of food slurry. Place pans on the appropriate labelled shelf in the large walk-in insectary. Tips for panning larvae: Before sucking larvae up into the pipette, suck up just distilled water to prevent larvae from sticking to the sides of the pipette. Pan out larvae as soon as possible, ideally 30 min to an hour after hatching. 300 larvae per pan is the optimal larval count for consistent and healthy larvae growth.","title":"II.

Collect larvae pans and check for adequate pupation (> 75%). Fill up with distilled water (a little more than \u00bc the cup). Obtain a clean pupae picker. Pick pupae. Fill orders if needed or place directly into the cage. If placing in the cage, label the pupae dish using the appropriate colored tape (pink: LVP, lime green: AaSD) and include the following information on the label: species name, date, date of emergence (two days from the current date), number of pupae in the cup, and your initials. Use a new picker or clean currently used picker before switching to the next species. Make sure your picker is clean and no tiny larvae are on it. Tips for picking pupae: Clean picker thoroughly or use a new one to ensure you are not transferring larvae, pupae or eggs to other pans. Put only 50 females in experimental cups. Males pupate about a day or two before females pupate. Female pupae are generally larger than male pupae in Aedes spp.. Separating pupae using the glass separator Obtain the pan(s) of mosquito larvae/pupae that you want to separate. Obtain a couple large plastic beakers with handles and a metal strainer. Place a large pan under the separator. Fill one beaker with water and rinse and clean the separator by forcefully pouring water over each of the four knobs and down the main panel of the separator. Do this thrice to ensure the separator is clean and no contaminating larvae or pupae are caught in the separator. After cleaning, empty the water from the large catch pan. Dump the mosquito pan(s) into the metal strainer and drain the water out. Rinse the larvae/pupae down in the corner of the strainer with lukewarm tap water. Dump larvae/pupae into one of the beakers with minimal lukewarm water. Tighten the bottom nobs so that a water line from the bottom of the separator to about two to three inches up the separator glass panel (do not tighten them all the way). Do not tighten top nobs, they should be all the way loose. Carefully and slowly dump the beaker of larvae/pupae/distilled water down through the top of the separator between the two glass plates. Only pour a small number of pupae/larvae at a time. Now loosen both the bottom nobs a very small amount and use gentle hand pressure to pull the front glass panel away from the back-glass panel (this moves the mosquitoes down the separator and allows them to keep in a straight line). Pour the beaker of distilled water down through the top of the separator slowly until the mosquitoes are an even line. Loosen the nobs again evenly. Pour more distilled water down the top of the separator. Repeat steps 11 through 14 until you have separated out the larvae. Dump larvae back into the metal strainer/pan/cup for whatever purpose they are needed. If not needed, place in a paper cup and put in freezer. Replace pan under the separator.

Turn on the heat block and allow it to warm up to 37\u00b0C. Aliquot 1X Aedes saline into 1.5 mL Eppendorf tubes. Place tubes in warming plate to allow to come to 37\u00b0C. Under sterile conditions, aliquot ~10 mL of pre-warmed RPMI-1640 amended with P/S and Gentamicin into a small 6 cm Petri dish. Place the Petri dish on top of the heat block to keep the RPMI-1640 warm. Place a large glass Petri dish lined with filter paper on ice. Cold anesthetize the mosquitoes in the cartons by placing the cartons in 4\u00b0C refrigerator until knocked down (~2-3 min). Once knocked down, put mosquitoes on top of the filter paper in the Petri dish and cover with the glass lid. Take a clean glass slide and in the center add a puddle of 1X Aedes saline using a transfer pipette. Using a dissecting probe or a forceps, transfer one adult female mosquito to the pool of saline. Use the dissecting probes to decapitate the mosquito. You may notice L3 beginning to migrate out of the back of the head. Pierce the mosquito head with one probe and use another probe to slice down the mosquito proboscis cutting it open. This will allow the L3 to escape the mouth parts. Allow the dissected head and mouthparts to incubate in the saline for a few minutes to allow all the L3 to migrate into saline. Once all L3 are in saline, individually transfer the L3 into the Petri dish containing the warm RPMI-1640 using a small worm hook (dissecting probe that has been curved into a small hook). Once all L3 have been transferred, place the dish of RPMI-1640 containing L3 back on the heat block and wipe off the slide on the glass slide with a Kimwipe. The slide can be reused. Repeat the above process until all mosquitoes have been dissected or until enough L3 have been collected. If there are undissected mosquitoes remaining, dump mosquitoes into an old mosquito carton and place it in the freezer. Discard spent tubes of media, Kimwipes and slides in the proper biohazard bins.

Preparing PEN Membrane Slides for Cryosectioning Under BSC, treat PEN membrane slides for 1 min with Eliminase. Rinse the slides by dipping 10 times with 1-2 seconds between dips in three successive conical tubes filled with 30 mL DEPC-treated water. Dip slides in 95% ethanol 10 times. Air-dry for 5\u201310 min. Cryosectioning Follow Follow the Cryosectioning to produce tissue sections for LCM. 20 \u00b5m sections are typically collected for all stages of filarial parasites. Transferring sections from cryostat onto PEN membrane Place a PEN Membrane on the back half of the main stage in the cryostat. Trim the embedded sample block until dye dot is visible. Count the number of slices passed until no more dye is visible. Calculate the number of slices required to reach tissue by comparing the number of dye slices across the dot to the width of the dot in pixels, this gives a slice to pixel ratio. Use the measurement between the end of the dot and the specimen to get another slice to pixel ratio. Solve for the theoretical number of slices it will take to get to the start of the worm by cross-multiplying. It is good practice to underestimate this number by at least 20% . Visibly inspect slices periodically under the microscope and proceed if no tissue is visible. Once you visibly see tissue in your section, using clean forceps, transfer the slice to the PEN membrane slide in a column-like fashion. Continue collecting slices until the PEN membrane slide is completely filled with sections (usually 35-40 sections per slide). Note: Use caution when transferring sections to the PEN membrane, so the PEN membrane doesn\u2019t get torn or punctured by the forceps. Remove the slide from the inside of the cryostat and move to room temperature for 2-5 minutes. Place the slide in a 50 mL conical tube. Leave the tube containing the slide at room temperature and bring back to the lab for processing. To process the slide, remove the slide from the conical tube and place in a clean cover from a pipette tip box. Using a p1000 pipette, carefully flood the slide with 70% EtOH. Let sit for 1-2 minutes. Tilt the slide to dump the ethanol off. Using a p1000 pipette, gently wash the slide with molecular grade water. Using a p1000 pipette, carefully flood the slide with 80% EtOH. Let sit for 1 minute. Tilt the slide to dump the ethanol off. If you notice white on the slide after removing the ethanol, this is the remaining OCT that has not been fully removed. Use a p1000 and molecular grade water to wash the white areas until the OCT is dissolved. Using a p1000 pipette, carefully flood the slide with 90% EtOH. Let sit for 1 minute. Tilt the slide to dump the ethanol off. Using a p1000 pipette, carefully flood the slide with 90% EtOH. Let sit for 1 minute. Tilt the slide to dump the ethanol off. Using a p1000 pipette, carefully flood the slide with 100% EtOH. Let sit for 1 minute. Tilt the slide to dump off the ethanol. Allow to air dry. Wipe the bottom and edges of the slide to facilitate quicker drying. Verify there are visible sections on the slide using compound microscopy. Place the slide back into the 50 mL conical tube, label the tube, and place it in the -80\u00baC until you are ready to go to the LCM. Isolating Regions of Interest from Whole-Mount Microfilariae Ethanol fixing mf Filter shipped mf using a 30 \u00b5m SWMP Millipore filter. Push the mf through the filter once, and collect the flow-through. Push the flow-through through a new 5 \u00b5m filter. Remove the filter from the filter holder using clean forceps and transfer to a 15 mL conical tube containing 1 mL of RPMI + 1% P/S. Rinse the filter off by swirling it around inside the conical tube using forceps. Remove the filter from the conical tube and discard. Transfer the contents of the conical tube to a 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube. Centrifuge at 1000 x g for 5 minutes. Remove the supernatant without disturbing the pellet of mf. Using a pipette, add 1 mL of 100% EtOH drop by drop to the pellet of mf. Once all the ethanol is added briefly vortex so the mf are evenly suspended throughout the ethanol. Label and place the tube of mf at -80\u00baC until you are ready to go to LCM. LCM Operation LCM Software Startup UW SDRC will start up the Arcturus LCM Machine and computer. Ask for the login username and password when you go for your first use. Once the main working panel loads, press Present Stage in the top right corner of the screen. This will allow you to load your Arcturus Caps and PEN membrane slides. Verify that the UV and IR settings are correct by clicking on Options then Microdissect, then Select Settings. The setting parameters are shown below: UV Settings: UV Tab Length: 3 Cut: 10 Current: 15 Cut Speed: 300 Frequency: 500 Thickness: 20 IR Settings: IR Spots: 3 Spacing: 60 Diameter: 75 Power: 99 Duration: 49 Preparation of PEN membrane slides containing Whole-Mount Microfilariae Place the sample of ethanol-fixed mf on wet-ice to bring to the LCM. At the LCM, when you are ready to add the slide to the machine, add the mf to the RNase treated PEN membrane slide (see above on how to prepare PEN membrane slides). Briefly vortex the tube by flicking so mf are evenly suspended in the ethanol. Using a p20 pipette, pipette 3-4 10 \u00b5L aliquots equidistant from each other along the length of the PEN Membrane. Allow the ethanol to evaporate before adding the slide to the machine. Preparation of PEN Membrane Slides containing Parasite Tissue Cross-Sections Remove from previously prepared PEN membrane slides from ice and immediately immerse in cold 100% ethanol for 30 seconds. Immerse the slide in room temperature 100% ethanol. Air dry slides for 2-3 minutes. This will prevent rehydration of sections and prevent re-activation of RNase activity during warming. Locating Parasite Samples for Microdissection Load your caps and slide onto the ArcturusXT system. Load slide (one at a time) so that the frosted part of the slide is pointing to the right, and the PEN membrane facing up. Push the tension button, in order to load the slides. Release tension button to lock slides into place. Select the location you put your slide (A, B, C) and click on the location of the Arcturus CapSure Cap. Acquire a slide overview by right-clicking in the slide overview area at the bottom of the screen, and click Acquire Overview Image. Once the slide overview image has been acquired, move the stage to display an area of interest on the PEN membrane by moving the trackball.

When you get to a section or mf add an IR spot by clicking near the tissue of interest, but not directly on top of the section. Click on the first number listed under Drawing Items. This will bring up the first tissue section or mf of interest. Use the trackball, focus, and brightness to make the image as clear as possible. View the mf at 20X and view adult tissue sections at 10X. Delete the first Drawing Item in Capture Group A by right clicking on the number and select the Delete Selected Item. Then switch to a different Capture Group (B-D). Draw three circles of 75 \u00b5m diameter on top of the mf using the IR Spot tool. Deselect the IR spot tool and select the Freehand drawing tool. Draw 3-4 lines following the arc on either side of Center #3 (refer to image above). Delete the IR Spots used to draw the circles on top of the mf. Then, using the Freehand drawing tool. Complete the circle using the two arcs previously made. Make one side of the circle longer than the other so it looks like a peanut. Once the circle has been made, add a few IR spots in the bigger end of the peanut. Make sure the IR spots are not touching the mf. Once the IR spots are added and the circle has been drawn to capture the desired area of tissue, click the Cut and Capture button. Verify that the cap captured and collected the tissue section of interest by moving the cap to a new area on the slide. You can either see the section in the new field of view, or you can go back to the section that you cut and see if the section has been removed. If microdissection was incomplete, you can repeat the cut and/or capture steps. Once the section has been captured, remove the previous IR spots and UV circle by selecting all in the corresponding Drawing Items in the Drawing Items box. Once all are selected, right click and select Delete Selected Objects. Repeat steps #3-10 until all mf sections are collected. Once all sections are collected, select the Move Cap to QC button.

A bleach solution can be prepared in the bleach-specific pitcher in the insectary (labeled with yellow tape) by adding ~\u00bd cup of bleach and 1 L of tap water. Important : Remove the sucrose pad(s) at least 2 hr before feeding for LVP and AaSD mosquito species. Starting with microfilaremic blood Invert the tube of infected blood several times to mix the microfilariae (mf). Note : If the microfilariae are shipped in multiple glass vials from the same subject, combine all of the vials into a single 50 mL conical tube and mix by inversion. Add 20 \u00b5L of infected blood to 50 \u00b5L of dH 2 O on a glass slide and stir with the pipette tip to mix. Add a cover slip to the slide. Adding the cover slip beginning at an angle and slowly lowering it will reduce bubbles in the middle of your slide. Return the mf back to the incubator while counting. Place the slide on a compound microscope and count the mf. Start at a corner of the cover slip and count the mf in the fluid outside of the coverslip. Once the perimeter has been counted, count the mf underneath the cover slip area using an s-pattern. (See figure below) Calculate the mf concentration in the microfilaremic blood stock. In a 15 mL or 50 mL conical tube, dilute the microfilaremic blood with Defibrinated Sheep's Blood to the desired blood feeding concentration. Use C 1 V 1 =C 2 V 2 to calculate how much microfilaremic blood and how much control blood to add to the conical tube. Note: The blood feeders used for feeding hold 10 mL of blood. When calculating final volume use 11 mL for 1 mL overage. Multiply this by number of feeders you will need. Appropriate concentrations for blood feeding: B. pahangi : 120 \u2013 160 mf / 20 \u00b5L D. immitis : 80 \u2013 160 mf / 20 \u00b5L Re-enumerate the mf in blood in duplicate to verify that it is within target concentration for the designated species (see target concentrations above). If concentration is off, re-calculate dilutions based on the new numbers and add defibrinated sheep's blood as needed. Starting with mf in IP fluid Invert the tube in order for mf to be evenly distributed throughout IP fluid. Use the concentration printed on the outside of the tube containing the IP fluid. Determine how much volume of IP fluid you will need to get the desired mf concentration for blood feeding by using C 1 V 1 =C 2 V 2 . Note: The blood feeders used for feeding hold 10 mL of blood. When calculating final volume use 11 mL for 1 mL overage. Multiply this by number of feeders you will need. Add the calculated amount of IP fluid to a 15 mL conical tube. Spin at 900 rpm for 10 min. You should see a pellet of mf at the bottom of the tube. Remove all supernatant without disturbing pellet. Add the final volume of blood you desire (11 mL x the number o feeders). Re-enumerate the mf in blood in duplicate to verify that it is within target concentration for the designated species (see target concentrations above). If concentration is off, re-calculate dilutions based on the new numbers and add defibrinated sheep's blood as needed. Assembling glass blood feeders and feeding mosquitoes Use the large glass blood feeders. Stretch a 2-square piece of parafilm pulled once in both directions and place it on the bottom of the glass feeder. Avoid wrinkles in the parafilm and secure the parafilm by smoothing it along the glass rim. Cut a second piece of parafilm (2 squares wide, half square tall) and stretch it around the bottom edge of the glass feeder. Secure the parafilmed glass feeder upside down on a metal ring stand and place on a cart in the insectary. Setup the water circulator on a cart in the insectary by filling it with dH 2 O to the black fill line. Attach the water circulator tubes to each inlet and outlet arm on the side of the glass feeders and wrap a piece of parafilm (2 squares wide, half square tall) around the connecting points. This will help control any water leaks. Turn the water circulator on and set the temperature to 37\u00b0C. In these feeders carefully place ~10 mL of diluted, infected blood into the top of the blood feeders using a disposable pipet. You need to make sure that the feeders are level so that the blood doesn\u2019t pool in one side and unevenly distribute the mf. Place a small strip of parafilm over the opening to the inner chamber where the infected blood was loaded into the glass feeder. Let the water, glass feeders, and blood equilibrate to 37\u00b0C prior to feeding. Place a carton of mosquitoes under a membrane feeder and slowly lower the feeder so that it rests atop the carton and is flush with the mesh of the carton. Allow the carton of females to feed for 30 \u2013 45 min. or until a majority of females have fed. While the mosquitoes are feeding, print out a carton label according to the example below: When feeding is complete, remove an aliquot of blood to confirm that the mf are still alive and active. Do not separate blood fed from non-blood fed mosquitoes at conclusion of feeding. Affix the carton label to the corresponding carton and place blood fed mosquitoes in the insect incubator. Allow the infection to incubate for 14-15 days before you extract L3 from the mosquitoes. Other important notes: Maintain the sucrose pads on the cartons daily . It will be important to communicate with the insectary manager or undergraduates to make sure sucrose pads are moistened every day including on the weekends. If you notice an accumulation of dead mosquitoes in the bottom of the carton, suck out the dead mosquitoes, empty the suction device into a plastic container and freeze the container overnight. The mosquitoes can then be placed in the trash the next day after freezing.

Thaw prior to use. The P/S stock is different from what is typically used for media/cell culture. Note: Items denoted with a * are items that need to be autoclaved ahead of time. Methods A. Extracting Miracidia from Mice Add 1.5 mL Pen/Strep to the saline solution. Decant ~300 mL into a beaker. Turn on the centrifuge so it has time to cool. Ready the CO 2 container, and place mice in the container. Euthanise the mice via CO 2 asphyxiation. Cervical dislocation should be performed prior to dissecting the livers. Prior to dissection of the livers, make sure to alcohol off the area of incision. Remove the liver and trim excess fat and tissue prior to placing it in the beaker with saline. After dissection, rinse the livers with saline to get rid of excess material, i.e. solution should be fairly clear/clean. Drain off the saline solution and pour the livers into the appropriate blender. Add enough saline to just cover the livers in the blender. Blend for 20 seconds on low, 10 seconds on high, 20 seconds on low, and 10 seconds on high (total of one minute). Divide the liver contents evenly between for 250 mL centrifuge bottles. Rinse out the blender to remove as much liver material as possible. Add rinsed liver to the centrifuge bottles as needed. Add enough saline to each bottle so that it comes up to the 250 mL mark. Make sure to balance the bottles prior to placing them in the centrifuge. Shake the bottle as well before spinning (cover the top with paper towel). Centrifuge for 15 minutes, 1600 rpm (509 g/swing bucket), 4\u00baC. Following centrifuging, decant the saline into a large beaker. The pellet should remain at the bottom. If it breaks free from the bottom, pour off as much saline as possible without losing any of the liver sludge. Add 250 mL of saline to the bottles, balance and shake well (you want to disrupt the pellet and get the liver material back into suspension). Repeat step 7. If you have more than 20 livers, you may need to repeat steps 8-10. The saline solution should be fairly clear. You'll need two flasks (per 20 livers). Add approximately 200 mL of pond water to each volumetric flask. Add 1.5 mL Pen/Strep to the pond water flasks. Microwave a beaker containing approximately 100 mL of pond water for 20 seconds. You want the pond water to be 32-34\u00baC. Following the final saline wash, decant the saline solution, add pond water to each bottle, and shake well. Pour the contents of each centrifuge bottle to the flask (two bottles/flask assuming you started with 20 livers; if you start with more livers you probably want to use another volumetric flask). Fill the flasks with pond water to the base of the neck. Remove any \"scum/bubbles\" from the top. You can use a large disposable pipette or a long glass pipette. Gently swirl the flasks in a circular motion (tot suspend the contents). Fill the flask with the warm pond water using a long pasture pipette (layering). Do you want to do this slowly so that you create a \"layer\" Between the contents at the bottom in the neck of the flask. As you feel with the warm pond water it should become increasingly clear. Remove any debris early in the filling (make sure it's not parasites). Cover the flask with tinfoil, except for a small area near the top. Place the flask next to a light source (uncovered area). Place 15 mL tubes in a bucket of ice to cool. Draw off the miracidia, only add approximately 4 mL/tube. After drawing off the miracidia, add back fresh, warm pond water to the 15 mL tubes. Put the tubes back on ice for 15 minutes. Prepare the CBSS+P/S. If it's a new bottle (100 mL), and one tube of the antibiotics (same stock concentration used for media/cell culture). Divide the contents into three 50 mL tubes, approximately 33 mL per tube (generally you will only need one tube/prep). Keep one tube in the hood, label the others and store at 4\u00baC until needed. Following 15 minutes, a majority of the miracidia should have settled to the bottom of the tubes. Spin the tubes for 1 minute, 4\u00baC, 1600 rpm. B. Transformation of Miracidia to Primary Sporocysts Note: All steps should be performed within the BSC. After spinning the tubes, immediately draw off the pond water with a pipette. Be careful not to draw up any parasites. Do this for all the tubes you have collected. Re-suspend the miracidia in approximately 1 mL of sterile CBSS+P/S (i.e. if you have four tubes, add approximately 330 \u00b5L to three tubes, make sure the parasites are in suspension, and add the contents to the tube that was not re-suspended. You'll end up with one tube in the end). Cover the tube and place back on ice for 5-6 minutes. Spin the parasites again for 1 minute, 4\u00baC, 1600 rpm. Draw off the CBSS+P/S with a pipette, once again using caution not to draw up the parasites. Re-suspend the miracidia with CBSS+P/S (approximately 5000 parasites/mL). Aliquot the parasite suspension into 24-well tissue culture plates (only use the center eight wells). Generally from 20 livers, you should end up with 14-18 wells. After filling the plate, put two small pieces of tape on the side to prevent the lid from accidentally coming off, and put the in the incubator (24-26\u00baC). C. Removal of ESP from Primary Sporocysts After the parasites have transformed to primary sporocysts, excretory-secretory products should be removed from the plates. Transformation generally occurs between 24-48 hours after the parasites have been placed in culture. Take a new tube of CBSS+P/S and let it come to room temperature. Gently re-suspend the parasites by swirling the plate. Le tthe parasites settle back to the bottom, remove as much of the media as possible from each of the wells and place it into a 15 mL tube. Gently re-suspend the parasites again and combine the wells using either a fire polish glass pipette or sterile plastic pipette (combine 3-4 wells). Add fresh media to the wells which you removed the parasite suspension. After the parasites settle, once again remove as much media as possible from the well. Take care not to remove any sporocysts and add the media to the 15 mL tube. Add media to the wells that contain the sporocyst, gently re-suspend, and re-distribute back into the wells which parasites were removed. Place the plates containing parasites back into the incubator. Spin the ESP to pellet the plates and any residual parasites. You can spin at room temperature, 2000 rpm, 6-10 minutes. Remove the supernatant, place back into a 15 mL tube (make sure it is a polypropylene/\"cloudy\" plastic). Add the appropriate amount of protease inhibitors (Roche Mini-tab Complete Protease Inhibitors, EDTA-free).

Each species of snail has their own labeled materials for maintenance and cleaning, which can ONLY be used for that species of snail. Get a pre-packaged Ziploc bag of lettuce from the freezer in room 311. Break off two large leaves of lettuce per tank (may need more depending on density of the tank). There are three tanks for each species of snail (BS90 and NMRI), six tanks total. There may be lettuce left over, put lettuce leftovers and put back in bag and in freezer. If the bag is empty, wash it out in the sink and hang to dry. These bags can be re-used. Note: Coordinate the purchase of lettuce two weeks before finishing existing supply. It is ordered from the Union, and gets delivered to the Hanson loading dock within a few days of placing the order. Cut the lettuce bottom off of each lettuce head. Package one head of lettuce per Ziploc bag. Do this in B7 and then bring up the bags of packaged lettuce to store in the -20\u00baC freezer in room 311. Shake in a little bit of Tetramin fish food. Look at the the styrofoam pieces floating on top of the tank. If you notice a high density of egg bundles you may want to add another piece of cut styrofoam. If a majority of egg sacs have hatched off of the styrofoam piece, you can remove and discard. This doesn't need to be done often (~ once per month). Optional: Remove old lettuce from the tanks unless there are many baby snails present. You need to use the long tongs that is labelled with the corresponding species to remove the old lettuce. Top off water levels using distilled water. There is a pitcher located by each species of snail that you should use. Note: If the Nalgene tank is out of water: spray down bottom of the tank, then then add 100 mL of pond water stock solution and 30 gallons of DI water to the tank. Repeat above procedure for the NMRI snails. Note: BS90 tanks have a tendency to be susceptible to mite contamination. Inspect the styrofoam pieces that contain the egg sacs to see if there are mites present. You will be able to see them moving around. They tend to be near or in the egg sacs. If the mites are a problem, you may want to start a snail nursery using a separate, small tank. Snail Nursery Startup Take a small, cleaned tank stored underneath the BS90 snail tanks. Fill the tank \u00bd to \u00be full with diluted pond water from the Nalgene tank. Take a fish tank hose and connect it to the grey air pump and clamp it to the nursery tank. Do not fill the tank with gravel (this will allow for easier access to baby snails, once hatched, to move to the larger colony tanks). Go into the BS90 tank that has the least amount of mite contamination and remove a piece of styrofoam that contained freshly laid egg sacs. Clean a pair of scissors with 70% EtOH. Cut away a few freshly laid egg clusters that you observe have no mite contamination. Put the trimmed egg sacs face down in the new nursery tank (3 weeks in a row, 3 egg sacs). Wait a week to feed snails. Tiny piece of lettuce and small amount of fish food to start with. You will need to scale the amount of each as your snails grow in size. Cleaning Tanks (Every 4-6 Months) Note: 4-6 months is the recommendation. If there is a dirty tank with a lot of babies that would be lost, don't clean it. Note: Each species of snail has their own labeled materials for maintenance and cleaning, which can ONLY be used for that species of snail. Fill a small tank half way with pond water. Use a fish net to get the snails out of the dirty tank (this doesn't get all the snails) and transfer them to the small holding tank. Note: You can tell if the snails are living if you can see the body of the snail. Sometimes the body retracts into the shell, but you will still see the black body if you look within the apperture of the snail. Dead snails shells will be empty and slightly white in colour. Scoop the remaining live snails with your freshly gloved hand and add to the holding tank. Remove old pieces of lettuce using tongs. Inspect the old pieces of lettuce for snails. If snails are on the lettuce remove and add to the small holding tank. Get two 5 gallon buckets (you will need two buckets as one bucket is not enough to hold all the old water from the tank). Put them on the floor next to the tanks that you are emptying. Disconnect the hoses from the grey air pump and the aerators in the tank. Rinse the hoses in the sink using DI water. Wash the plastic lid that covers the top of the tank. Use DI water and a bottle brush scrub the lid clean. Remove styrofoam pieces. Optional: Inspect the styrofoam pieces, if they are heavily contaminated with mites, do not transfer to the new tank. If the mite contamination is low, cut away egg sacs with no mites, and put those in the holding tank and discard the rest of the styrofoam pieces. Use the syphon apparatus to remove water from the tank. Curl up the hose and submerge the whole syphon in the fish tank water. Put your thumb over the hose end after the syphon fills with water. Leave the syphon end in the tank but take the hose end, and guide the hose into the 5 gallon buckets. Release thumb, and let drain into the buckets. Empty until 1\" remaining. Note: If water is not draining, re-insert the syphon by putting your thumb over the tubing end and allow the syphon to fill with water. Try draining the water into the bucket again. Pick the remaining living snails out of the tank, and transfer to the holding tank. Discard dead snails into a plastic junk container and any remaining pieces of old lettuce. Empty the two 5 gallon buckets, containing old water, down the sink. Scoop the old gravel off the bottom of the tank using a small plastic cup. You will have to sort through gravel and pick out any remaining snails and either put in holding tank (living) or junk container (dead). Once the gravel has been inspected for snails and debris, dump it into an emptied 5 gallon bucket. After a majority of the gravel has been emptied from the tank into the bucket, dump the gravel into a metal strainer. Remove the bottom platform from the base of the tank and tilt on the side. Remove the plastic aerator stacks from the platform. Remove the old glove and zip tie covering the middle hole on the platform and discard. Wash the aerator stacks, and platform using DI water and the large bottle brush. Some gravel will be left on the bottom of the tank. Bring the tank over to the sink and rinse the bottom of the tank with DI water. Dump the water and remaining gravel into the metal strainer. Note: Avoid dumping gravel down the sink drain. Wash the gravel really good with DI water. Set the washed gravel on the bottom shelf to dry. Clean out the tank with DI water and the large bottle brush. Use a clean razor blade to clean the old lettuce off the rim of the tank and around the edges of the tank. Rinse the tank with water at least 3 times to make sure you get rid of mites and debris. Put the tank back on the shelf. Re-assemble the platform by re-inserting the aerator stacks, and placing a piece of nitrile glove over the middle hole and zip tie it into place. Place on the bottom of the clean tank. One autoclaved container of rocks goes on the bottom of the tank and over the platform. Fill the tank 80% full with pond water from the large Nalgene tank. Add 6 half sticks of chalk. Add 4 styrofoam cup pieces. Remove old gloves and put new gloves on. Hand pick the snails out of the holding tank and add back to the colony tank. Note: Do not dump the water and snails from the holding tank into the new tank. This will minimize risk of mite contamination. Top off the tank with pond water and reconnect the tubing to the aerator stacks and air pump. Feed a little bit of fish food and a little bit of lettuce. Label the tank with the correct coloured label containing the date and species of snail (yellow: BS90, red: NMRI). Dump the gravel that has been drying into one of the large metal autoclave containers. Set back on the bottom shelf with the lid off to allow to dry overnight. The next day, place the lid onto the metal autoclave bin containing the gravel and add autoclave tape on two sides of the container to secure the lid to the bottom bin. Autoclave as needed. Clean the small holding tank, dishes and buckets used to clean the tank.

Put the tank back on the shelf. Re-assemble the platform by re-inserting the aerator stacks, and placing a piece of nitrile glove over the middle hole and zip tie it into place. Place on the bottom of the clean tank. One autoclaved container of rocks goes on the bottom of the tank and over the platform. Fill the tank 80% full with pond water from the large Nalgene tank. Add 6 half sticks of chalk. Add 4 styrofoam cup pieces. Remove old gloves and put new gloves on. Hand pick the snails out of the holding tank and add back to the colony tank. Note: Do not dump the water and snails from the holding tank into the new tank. This will minimize risk of mite contamination. Top off the tank with pond water and reconnect the tubing to the aerator stacks and air pump. Feed a little bit of fish food and a little bit of lettuce. Label the tank with the correct coloured label containing the date and species of snail (yellow: BS90, red: NMRI). Dump the gravel that has been drying into one of the large metal autoclave containers. Set back on the bottom shelf with the lid off to allow to dry overnight. The next day, place the lid onto the metal autoclave bin containing the gravel and add autoclave tape on two sides of the container to secure the lid to the bottom bin. Autoclave as needed. Clean the small holding tank, dishes and buckets used to clean the tank. Repeat the above steps for all tanks.","title":"Cleaning Tanks (Every 4-6 Months)"},{"location":"protocols/Tasks/Staff_Tasks/Staff_Tasks/","text":"Staff Maintenance Tasks General Lab Upkeep The items below occur as needed .

Use 70% ethanol and a paper towel to wipe and clean all the benches in the lab. Clean the area near the analytical balance. Use 70% ethanol on a paper towel to gather specks of chemicals. Clean the inside of the balance and the area outside of it. Do not just brush powders onto the floor! Brush powders into a trash can. Clean/tidy up the gel area. Empty waste containers of pipette tips into the sharps' containers (blue, \"broken glass\" cardboard box for non-biohazard tips). Refer to \"Sharps and Laboratory Glass Disposal\" poster for more information. Take care of general lab waste. There are \"Waste\" and \"Liquid Waste\" plastic containers on benches. \"Waste\" containers will be in boxes (pipette tips). These should be disposed of in an autoclave bag and then placed in the MERI bin on the loading dock. \"Liquid Waste\" containers need to be placed in the sink with the addition of a little bit of bleach. Let the bleach and waste soak for at least 30 minutes, empty it out in the sink, rinse with distilled water (right-most faucet at the sink), and place it on the drying pads for washing through the glass washer machine. Biohazard bag decontamination. There are several red containers around the lab with autoclave bags in them. When these are ~75% full, take out the autoclave bag and tie it closed. Use lab tape to ensure it stays closed. Label the bag with our lab name and then place the bag in the MERI bin on the loading dock. Glass washing and autoclaving. This is very important. Refer to Glass/Plastic Washing and Autoclave Operation for instructions. Cleaning equipment. Wipe equipment in the lab with a Kimwipe lightly sprayed with 70% ethanol. This includes the heat block, microcentrifuges (outside and inside the machine), microscope glass stages, Qubit exterior, and thermal cycler exteriors. Be gentle and do not spray ethanol directly onto any electronics or equipment - remember these are very expensive machines and we want them to last a long time. Clean microscope lenses. Spray Sparkle (purple glass cleaner) on a Kimwipe and gently wipe the lenses of all of the microscopes (in Rooms 223, 229, and 230). Refilling bleach/ethanol spray bottles. 10% bleach and 70% ethanol bottles need to be refilled.
