We will also be using it to manage our Python environments. Conda will make it easy to invoke different Python versions as needed for different tasks. Instead of installing software to the entire machine, you install it only in a contained environment.

It will also add the path <code>$HOME/miniconda3/bin</code> to your lookup <code>$PATH</code>, which allows you to run conda executables without referring explicitly to their location.</p>"},{"location":"comp_conda/#usage-and-an-example","title":"Usage and an Example","text":"<p>Now that conda is installed, let's look at how virtual environments work. First, let's create a new environment that uses Python 3.9:</p> <p><code>conda create --name test_environment python=3.9</code></p> <p>The environment has now been created. You can see a list of all the environments that you have ever created with <code>conda env list</code>.</p> <p>Here is a list of current environments on my machine (* marks current environment):</p> <pre><code># conda environments:\n#\nbase                  *  /Users/$username/miniconda3\ndev                      /Users/$username/miniconda3/envs/dev\ntest_environment         /Users/$username/miniconda3/envs/test_environment\n</code></pre> <p>To activate the <code>test_environment</code> that you just created:</p> <p><code>source activate test_environment</code></p> <p>Now you are in the virtual environment, using Python 3.9 as a default. You can check to make sure this is the case with <code>python --version</code>.</p> <p>You can also see the path to your environment's Python with <code>which python</code>.</p> <p>Now that you are in the correct environment, you can begin adjusting it to suit your purposes. The main way to do this is by installing certain Python packages that you may use in your analysis. There are multiple ways to install a Python package. The primary means of installation <code>conda install {package name}</code>. If you receive a <code>PackagesNotFoundError</code>, search to identify other means of conda installation. This may include tapping different channels such as bioconda or conda-forge (e.g., <code>conda install --channel bioconda {package name}</code>).</p> <p>If a package is not available from conda, you may use <code>pip install {package name}</code>. While conda attempts to be compatible with pip, you may occasionally run into issues with packages installed through this route.</p> <p>Package installation example: As an example, we will use conda to install numpy. Numpy is a popular package used for scientific computing, typically computing that involve matrices. First make sure you are in the correct environment, then run:</p> <p><code>conda install numpy</code></p> <p>You should receive a message reporting the successful installation of the package. You can ensure successful installation by running Python with <code>python</code> and then attempting to load the package with <code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import numpy as np</code>. If the package was successfully loaded, you will get no message. If it was unsuccessful, you will see:</p> <pre><code> ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'numpy'\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"comp_conda/#zamanian-lab-environments","title":"Zamanian Lab Environments","text":"<p>Whenever we begin a new analysis that will include Python scripts, it is the developer's responsibility to build a conda environment that is suitable for those scripts.

The pad should be at about the same height as the worms on a plate so you don't have to focus around too much when switching back and forth.</p> </li> <li> <p>Place a small dot of halocarbon oil on a part of the worm plate with no bacteria. Pick some worms from the bacterial lawn to the oil. This just makes it easier to get the worms off the pick when transferring them to the agarose pad.

The trick is to stick the animals down in the same orientation so that each animal's vulva is pointed to the same side. You don't want the syncytial gonad to be on top or underneath the animal. When the animal is in the oil, the syncytial gonad is visible as two clear areas towards the anterior and posterior of the animal. To stick the animal right, wait until it is floating in the oil so that it's body flexures go sideways, not up and down, and pat the animal down on the agarose pad with your pick until it is stuck to the pad. Avoid storking or patting the animal on the head, which can kill it. Ideally, the animal will be fully immobilized except for its head, which will still be free and wiggling. the animals stick best when they first touch the pad. If you fail to stick them on the first try, the pad will not stick to the same part of the animal again. Practice sticking down a whole set of animals in a line in the same orientation for assembly line injecting. Once the animals are in the oil, work reasonably fast to get the procedure over with before the animals dehydrate (roughly 10 min.).</p>"},{"location":"protocols/Microinjection/Ce_Microinjection/Ce_Microinjection/#injection","title":"Injection","text":"<ol> <li> <p>Raise the injection needle off of the stage to allow room to put the injection pad with worms on the floating stage.</p> </li> <li> <p>Using the 10X objective find the worm, make sure it is in the correct orientation (vulva away from the needle). You can move or rotate the entire stage to move the worm, although some like to move the coverslip itself. It is best to have the worm at a 45\u00b0 angle to the needle; this maximizes the path length for the needle inside the gonad, helping to make sure you get the tip in the gonad instead of going all the way through and out the other side.</p> </li> <li> <p>Carefully lower the needle into the focal plane with the fine adjuster.

Here are two: (1) use your right index finger to gently tap the micromanipulator on the little box with the ball joint in it (just above where the arm the needle is on is attached). This vibrates the needle a little so that it punctures the worm. (2) slowly move the floating stage until the needle presses up against the body wall. Push slightly harder to enter the gonad. Hopefully, the tip of the needle is in the gonad now.</p> </li> <li> <p>Press the pedal to start the flow of DNA solution. If you're in the gonad it should be obvious; as the gonad is flooded it bloats like you're filling a sausage, and you can sometimes see the nuclei in the syncytium reacting to the flow. You want to put as much liquid in the gonad as possible; hopefully it will flow all the way around turn of the gonad. You will be able to see the green dye filling the gonad.

Others try to inject both. If you miss the gonad, you will see green liquid filling the pseudocoelom. Usually, the animal will survive, and you can just try again.

Therefore, each F<sub>1</sub> should be picked to a different plate to try to get independent lines.</p> </li> <li> <p>Three days after picking individual F<sub>1</sub> transformants, check the plates to see if these have transmitted the co-injection marker to the next generation at a high rate (ideally, up to 90-100% of progeny for really good injections, but over 50% can be good enough for some strains). Continue to propagate these plates to the F2 generation and beyond (to ensure they don't suddenly lose the marker). Perform lysis reactions and PCRs to check for the desired transgenes in these lines. Once confirmed via PCR, pick the three highest transmitted independent lines to freeze and name with the lab naming convention \"ZAM#\". Chunk from the F2 plates (we want to freeze strains at the \"earliest\" point of their birth).</p> </li> </ol> <p>Note: Typically, people inject 10-20 P<sub>0</sub>'s, and you should expect to get 0-300 F<sub>1</sub> transformants. Of the F<sub>1</sub> transformants, typically about 5-70% will transmit the array, allowing a line to be established. These lines transmit the array to 30-100% of their progeny. There is variation among lines transformed with the same DNA. For example, only a fraction of lines transformed with a cosmid/co-injection marker might give rescue of a mutant phenotype, and the strength of the rescue (the penetrance and/or expressivity) will vary among lines that show rescue. For a conservative analysis of gene function, one should look at six lines before they tentatively believe any result. Additionally, GFP fusion constructs can be used to identify the tissue or cell where your favorite gene is expressed. Transgene arrays are composed of concatemers of whatever was injected in random order, orientation, and composition. For example, transgenes can combine the co-injection marker promoter to GFP. Be careful when interpreting transgenic lines, either rescue or expression. Some lines transmit at only a few percent per generation. The frequency of transmission varies from animal to animal. Keep lines with low transmission, as they are more useful than high transmitting lines for integrating the transgene (integration creates 100% transmission). Also, transmission, rescue, and expression from some transgenes change over time, likely due to changes in chromatin structure.</p>"},{"location":"protocols/Microinjection/Injection_Rig_Preparation/Injection_Rig_Preparation/","title":"Injection Rig Preparation","text":""},{"location":"protocols/Microinjection/Injection_Rig_Preparation/Injection_Rig_Preparation/#compressor","title":"Compressor","text":"<p>Adapted from Panther Air Compressor </p> <ol> <li> <p>Turn the knob on the automatic ON/OFF - Pressure Switch to the ON position.

Things to note:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Restriction digest: ensure the digest completed by running an aliquot on a gel. In our experience, you do NOT need to gel purify the correct sized band - the off-target band will not impede the assembly. However, you DO need to inactivate the restriction enzymes. Some NEB enzymes can be heat inactivated at 65\u00b0C for 20 minutes, but check the specifications of the enzymes to be used. If you can\u2019t heat inactivate, you will need to purify using the PCR purification kit.</p> </li> <li> <p>PCR: use a high-fidelity polymerase from NEB, typically Q5. The polymerase you choose should correspond to the polymerase you selected when using the NEBuilder Assembly Tool. For these PCR reactions, do 25 \u03bcL reactions for 35 cycles, and use the Tm that the Assembly Tool provided (3\u2019 Ta). If the combined PCR products make up greater than \u2155 of the final assembly reaction, you should purify the PCR reactions. In general, it\u2019s probably better to purify.</p> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Thaw the reaction constituents on ice.

Empty the two 5 gallon buckets, containing old water, down the sink.</li> </ul> <p></p> </li> <li> <p>Scoop the old gravel off the bottom of the tank using a small plastic cup. You will have to sort through gravel and pick out any remaining snails and either put in holding tank (living) or junk container (dead).</p> <p></p> </li> <li> <p>Once the gravel has been inspected for snails and debris, dump it into an emptied 5 gallon bucket. After a majority of the gravel has been emptied from the tank into the bucket, dump the gravel into a metal strainer.</p> <p></p> <p></p> </li> <li> <p>Remove the bottom platform from the base of the tank and tilt on the side.

Bring the tank over to the sink and rinse the bottom of the tank with DI water. Dump the water and remaining gravel into the metal strainer.</p> <p>Note: Avoid dumping gravel down the sink drain.    </p> </li> <li> <p>Wash the gravel really good with DI water. Set the washed gravel on the bottom shelf to dry.</p> </li> <li> <p>Clean out the tank with DI water and the large bottle brush. Use a clean razor blade to clean the old lettuce off the rim of the tank and around the edges of the tank. Rinse the tank with water at least 3 times to make sure you get rid of mites and debris.</p> </li> <li> <p>Put the tank back on the shelf. Re-assemble the platform by re-inserting the aerator stacks, and placing a piece of nitrile glove over the middle hole and zip tie it into place. Place on the bottom of the clean tank. One autoclaved container of rocks goes on the bottom of the tank and over the platform.</p> <p></p> </li> <li> <p>Fill the tank 80% full with pond water from the large Nalgene tank. Add 6 half sticks of chalk. Add 4 styrofoam cup pieces. Remove old gloves and put new gloves on. Hand pick the snails out of the holding tank and add back to the colony tank.</p> <p></p> <p>Note: Do not dump the water and snails from the holding tank into the new tank. This will minimize risk of mite contamination.</p> </li> <li> <p>Top off the tank with pond water and reconnect the tubing to the aerator stacks and air pump. Feed a little bit of fish food and a little bit of lettuce. Label the tank with the correct coloured label containing the date and species of snail (yellow: BS90, red: NMRI).  </p> </li> <li> <p>Dump the gravel that has been drying into one of the large metal autoclave containers. Set back on the bottom shelf with the lid off to allow to dry overnight. The next day, place the lid onto the metal autoclave bin containing the gravel and add autoclave tape on two sides of the container to secure the lid to the bottom bin.
