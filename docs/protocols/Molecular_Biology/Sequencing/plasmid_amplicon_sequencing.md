# Plasmid and Amplicon Sequencing

In addition to sequencing technologies available at the Biotech Center on campus, full-length plasmid and amplicon sequencing is available through [Plasmidsaurus](https://www.plasmidsaurus.com/) (see directions below).

## UW Biotech Center Sequencing
**Note:** An account with the UWBC Requester Portal is required to submit any samples to campus sequencing services. Access to the portal can be requested by emailing <u>nextgen-seq@biotech.wisc.edu</u> or by following the instructions posted [here](https://dnaseq.biotech.wisc.edu/submission/).

The UW Biotech Center's [Interactive Submission Guideline](https://uw-biotech-center.my.site.com/guidelines/s/) provides application-specific instructions for all sample types. Please follow these sample preparation, naming, labeling, and submission guidelines to properly submit samples for long-read plasmid or amplicon sequencing services. 


## Plasmidsaurus Sequencing

### Materials

- 8-well strip tubes
- parafilm
- 50 mL conical tube
- plasmids/amplicons (>10 µL at 30 ng/µL)

### Protocol

1. Use the Qubit to measure the concentration of each plasmid/amplicon and normalize each to 30 ng/µL with nuclease-free water. Add at least 10 µL of each plasmid to a tube in a 8-well strip tube. Label the samples by writing the order label on the first tube and the strip number on the second tube of each strip. No additional labeling is necessary. Refer to the Plasmidsaurus [guildelines](https://plasmidsaurus.com/shipping_instructions) for any clarifications. 

2. When all samples for sequencing are ready and aliquoted into the strip tube(s), use parafilm to seal the caps and ensure they do not open during transit. Place the strip tube(s) in a 50 mL conical tube and add a copy of the sample submission form and your samples to a ziploc bag.

3. Submit a plasmid sequencing order through [Plasmidsaurus](https://www.plasmidsaurus.com/). You will need to create an account if you do not already have one. Enter the plasmid names in the exact order they were deposited into the 8-well strip tubes. 

  - Free Plasmidsaurus submission dropboxes are located throughout campus at the following locations:

    | Building | Address | Pick-up Day/Time | Dropbox ID# |Notes | 
    |----------|--------| ------ | ---- | --- |
    | HF DeLuca Biochemical Laboratories Building | 433 Babcock Drive | M-F 2:30 pm | 65 | Small styrofoam box next to the ice maker labeled "Plasmidsaurus" |

   
   
4. Time your sample drop-off so that the samples are not sitting out at RT for too long. Include a copy of the submission form with your sample and put an additional physical copy on Kathy's desk and the digital receipt in the pcard receipts folder on Box.

5. Plasmidsaurus will email the results usually within 24 hrs. Please transfer the results to Box > Data > Plasmidsaurus in a folder labeled with the submission date.
