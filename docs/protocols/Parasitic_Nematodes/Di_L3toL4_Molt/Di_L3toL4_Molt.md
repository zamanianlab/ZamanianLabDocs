    Preparing NCTC if using powder form (1/8th the packet). Store at 4°C for up to one month.

      | NCTC Media Component    | Volume/Quantity (125 mL) |
      |----------------------------|------------------------|
      |NCTC-135 Powder             |1.16 g                  |
      |NaHCO<sub>3</sub>           |0.28 g                  |
      |H<sub>2</sub>O              |125 mL                  |
      |HEPES (1M) - optional       |3.125 mL                |

    Preparing Molting Media (NCTC-IMDM)

      | NI Media Component    | Volume/Quantity (100 mL) |
      |----------------------------|------------------------|
      |NCTC                        |40 mL                  |
      |IMDM                        |40 mL                  |
      |Pen-Strep (100X)            |1 mL (10 U/mL final)                 |
      |Gentamicin (100X)           |1 mL (100 ug/mL final)               |
      |Fungin (1000X)              |100 µL (10 ug/mL final)               |
      |Ciprofloxacin (1000X) - optional      |100 µL (10 ug/mL final)                |
      |FBS                         |20 mL (20% final)        |

    Alternatively, replace P/S and Fungin with 100X Antibiotic-Antimycotic.

2. Replace cap on media bottle and shake to mix. Filter the media using a 0.22 µm filter.

3. Label filtered media with: name of media, volume, date prepared, and initials. Store media at 4°C. Media is good for 1 month post-preparation.

### Extraction of *D. immitis* L3 from mosquitoes

Follow this [Protocol](../L3_Extraction/L3_Extraction.md)

### Preparing parasites and culture plates (24-well bulk culture)

1. Wash infective larvae:
    - Transfer infective larvae in minimal amount of RPMI-1640 to a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube.
    - Spin the microcentrifuge tube at 1000 x g for 10 minutes.
    - Pipette 100 μL from bottom of tube and transfer to new tube containing 500 μL RPMI.
    - To prevent worm loss, check wash from original tube by pipetting remaining solution into petri dish and examining under dissecting microscope. If a significant number of worms were left behind, pipette into the new tube with NI and spin again.
    - Repeat spin/washing infective larvae in media three times following the steps above.

2. Under BSC, pipette 200 μL from bottom of microcentrifuge tube and transfer to new petri dish containing pre-warmed, sterile culture media

3. Prepare 24-well cell culture plates with 800 µL of culture media under sterile conditions. **Optional:** Add a transwell to each well using a sterile forceps (Fisher Scientific 07-200-154).

4. Transfer desired number of infective larvae (typically 25) in a volume of 200 µL from petri dish to each
well in 24-well plates (total volume = 1 mL). Total of 600 larvae is typically used to fill an entire plate. Larvae are incubated at 37°C with 5% CO2.

5. Change media under BSC every two days by transferring worms (in transwells) to new wells containing fresh culture media using sterile forceps.

6. L3 molting should be monitored daily using a compound scope at 40x-200x total magnification.

**Note**: A majority of *D. immitis* L3 should molt within the first 2-3 days in culture.


### Preparing parasites and culture plates (96-well individual culture)

1. Prepare a 96-well cell culture plate by adding 200 µL of molting culture media per well under sterile conditions.

2. Wash freshly extracted L3, as described above.

3. Transfer one L3 in a volume of 1 µL from petri dish containing culture media and L3 to each well of a 96-well plate.

4. Place plate containing individually cultured L3 at 37°C with 5% CO2

5. L3 molting should be monitored daily using a compound scope at 40x-200x total magnification.

## L3-L4 Molt (in bulk)

### Materials:
- 100 mL molting media
- 10 or 6 cm petri dish
- 50 mL conical tube
- 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube

### Protocol:
1. Once L3's have been isolated and transferred to a 50 mL conical tube, allow them to settle for 1 hr at 37°C.

2. Aspirate to ~3 mL of the supernatant without disturbing the settled L3's.

3. Using a p1000 pipette, transfer 1 mL of the settled L3's to a 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube.

4. Allow the L3 to settle for 5 min at 37°C. 

5. Aspirate the supernatant without disturbing the settled L3's.

6. Add 1 mL of pre-warmed molting media.

7. Repeat steps 4-6 for a total of 3 times to wash the L3's.

8. While waiting for the L3's to settle, add pre-warmed molting media to a 10 or 6 cm petri dish.

9. Transfer the L3's to the petri dish and keep in an incubator at 37°C +5% CO2.
   - Allow the L3's to molt to L4's for 5 days.
   - Monitor the L3's daily under a dissecting microscope and change the media every two days by following the wash steps above.
