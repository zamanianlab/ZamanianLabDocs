# Making HB101 Stocks 

## Materials

- HB101 frozen stock
- LB agar 10cm plate (see [*C. elegans* recipes](../Celegans_Recipes/Celegans_Recipes.md))
- Inoculation Loop
- LB media (see [*C. elegans* recipes](../Celegans_Recipes/Celegans_Recipes.md))
- K medium (see [*C. elegans* recipes](../Celegans_Recipes/Celegans_Recipes.md))
- Autoclaved water 
- 50mL falcon tube 
- Flasks: 150mL, 1L 
- 1.5mL tubes 

## Protocol

1. Streak HB101 from frozen stock onto LB agar plate (make sure to use plate within a week). 

2. Inoculate 1 colony in 50mL LB and incubate for 16 hr at 37°C and 220rpm. 

3. Inoculate 500mL of LB with 500µL of overnight culture and incubate for 13hrs at 37°C and 220rpm (OD<sub>600</sub> should be between 0.8 and 0.9). 

4. Pre-weigh 2 50mL tubes and record the weight on the tube. Transfer the bacterial culture from the flask to these 2 tubes and 8 additional 50mL tubes. 

5. Centrifuge these 10 tubes for 10mins at 3,000 x g. 

6. Discard the supernatant LB and repeat steps 4 and 5 until all bacteria is pelleted. 

7. Discard LB supernatant and add 4-mL of autoclaved H<sub>2</sub>O to 2 of the 10 tubes. 

    a. Vortex to resuspend the bacterial pellets. 

    b. Sequentially transfer the volume to 4 other tubes and vortex to resuspend. 

    c. This should combine the pellets of the 10 tubes into the 2 pre-weighed tubes. 
    **Note:** If the pellet is large, 20mL can be added  initially to get the pellet into solution and 40mL added after the pellet is resuspended. 

8. Centrifuge the 2 tubes for 10mins at 3,000 x g. 

9. Discard the supernatant H<sub>2</sub>O and resuspend the pellet in 40mL of autoclaved H<sub>2</sub>O via vortexing. 

10. Centrifuge for 10mins at 3,000 x g. 

11. Discard teh supernatant H<sub>2</sub>O and weigh the tubes to calculate the weight of the bacterial pellets. 

12. Resuspend and combine pellets to a final concentration of 50 mg/mL in K-medium. 

    a. Pellet total weight = X grams. Total resuspension volume = 20 * X mL of K-medium. 
        *Example: 1.8g pellet should be resuspended in 36 mLs (= 36 x 1mL aliquotes)*

    b. Thoroughly vortex and then shake for a half hour at room temperature to resuspend. 

13. Aliquot into 1mL units in 1.5mL tubes. 

14. Flash freeze. 

15. Store in a box labelled "HB101 LTA food stocks" and the date at -80°C. 
**Note:** These aliquots are effectively 20x stocks. This means 5µl of these aliquots can be used per 100µl well of 50 worms, or 500µl can be used per 96-well plate.
