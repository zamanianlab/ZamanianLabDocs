# Zamanian Lab Computational Environment

Zamanian lab academic staff will be expected to use macOS and maintain a local environment that is generally consistent across all lab machines. Follow the instructions on the following pages to create necessary accounts and establish your local computational environment.

  - [Local Environment](comp_local.md): Instructions to establish a shared macOS environment. This includes common programs, bash profile, R version and package control, [Conda and Python](comp_conda.md), and [Homebrew](comp_homebrew.md) packages.

  - [Data Storage](comp_storage.md): Overview of storage and backup solutions for small and large datasets.

  - [GitHub](comp_github.md): Most tool development and analyses will incorporate version control with GitHub. Follow these instructions to create your account and join the `@zamanianlab` organization.

While some core lab pipelines can be carried out locally, some will occur on campus servers (e.g., processing of image or sequencing data). Information on how to organize lab pipelines can be found on our [Pipelines](pipelines_overview.md) landing page.
