# Data Storage

## Box (Small Data)

Small data (e.g., tabular data from various instruments) should stored on Box alongside code for analysis. All data (large and small) will be processed using local or server pipelines to produce small outputs (or subsets of outputs) that should be stored on Box for downstream analysis and plotting. Box will be backed up to ResearchDrive once every three months.

## UW ResearchDrive (Large Data)

Large data (e.g., sequencing and imaging) will be stored on [ResearchDrive](https://it.wisc.edu/services/researchdrive), which provides 25 TB (expandable) of secure storage with off-site backup. Lab members will have access to the lab ResearchDrive using their UW net-id and password. Our sequencing data from the BRC is automatically moved into ResearchDrive. General instructions on how to connect to and transfer data in and out of ResearchDrive are provided [here](https://kb.wisc.edu/researchdata/internal/page.php?id=93998). Data will be transferred from ResearchDrive to the CHTC for pipeline-based processing. Outputs will be transferred from the CHTC back to ResearchDrive for long-term storage and [Box](https://www.box.com) for post-processing, analysis and plotting. The current ResearchDrive directory structure is shown below:

```

├── ImageXpress/ (or /WormViz, /i3x ...etc)
|   └── raw/                              [Raw exported data]
|   └── metadata/                         [Experiment metadata]    
|   └── proc/                             [CHTC-processed data]

Instructions can be found for [connecting](https://kb.wisc.edu/researchdata/internal/page.php?id=93998#connect) to and [transferring](https://kb.wisc.edu/researchdata/internal/page.php?id=93998#transferdata) files in and out of ResearchDrive. Files can be transferred into the mounted ResearchDrive using a number of [approaches](https://kb.wisc.edu/researchdata/96641), including simple drag-and-drop or command-line `rsync` or `cp`.

To connect to the lab UW Research Drive, follow the instructions below and login with your UW net-id and password.

  ```
  Mac: Finder "Connect to server" > smb://research.drive.wisc.edu/mzamanian

  rsync -rltv ~/Desktop/Data/[dir] /Volumes/mzamanian/ImageXpress/raw/
  ```

## SVM L Drive (UW SVM)

To connect to the lab SVM L Drive, follow the instructions below and login with your UW net-id and password.

  ```
  Mac: Finder "Connect to server" > smb://svm-files.ad.wisc.edu/ZamanianLab

  PC: mount as L: drive (smb:\\svm-files.ad.wisc.edu\ZamanianLab)
  ```

## UW S3 Storage

UW S3 storage will be used for archival storage. UW RD and L drive 

## BRC (UW Biotech Center)

Sequencing data generated by the UW Biotechnology Center is delivered to the BRC servers. These data can be accessed in [numerous ways](https://www.biotech.wisc.edu/services/brc/data-access). Our sequencing data are auto-deposited into ResearchDrive and so directly accessing these files may not be necessary.
